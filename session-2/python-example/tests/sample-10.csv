171631,431 words,The Telegraph-Journal (New Brunswick),MAIN; Pg. A3,Music festival to raise funds for nature trust,2012,"While living in Toronto and England, musician Kelly-Sue O'Connor yearned to be back home in gorgeous Albert County. After a 10-year separation, she arrived in the Hillsborough area two years ago, a relief from what she calls the concrete jungle. With a newborn baby, she settled down, found a job and volunteered with the Nature Trust Of New Brunswick. At the beginning of June, she set out to create a day-long music festival in Hillsborough to raise funds for the nature trust. In less than a month, with the help of a few friends, she had 12 bands signed up for the event and it's now ready to go. ""I'm so shocked at how fast it came together,"" said O'Connor. ""How fast everyone got on board. We have the bands, the sponsors; we have audio, the stage and lights."" The music marathon, called The Bore Music Festival, will be held at the town's Kiwanis building on July 28 and will feature some of the East Coast's finest folk-indie bands. The music will begin at noon and continue until midnight, all for a ticket cost of $24. ""I wanted to bring the music scene to me and this community and expose people to some great music,"" said O'Connor, who hails from Stoney Creek, about 10 kilometres north of Hillsborough. ""We have great bands on board and I'm looking forward to having a great time."" Headlining will be Paper Beat Scissors, also known as Halifax's Tim Crabtree. His music has received rave reviews across North America and he's a regular on CBC Radio 2. There's plenty of other talent to look forward to as well - from Lovestorm - duo Tim Isaac and Nina Khosla - to piano-infused folk-indie artist Zwerg from Moncton and bluegrass/folk musician Jens Jeppesen. The lineup has been handpicked by O'Connor herself. ""I wanted to actually like the music,"" she said. ""I wanted to mix in the folk-indie scene, have a singer-songwriter feel to it."" All the money will go back into the Nature Trust Of New Brunswick and enhancing nature in her own backyard. She's hoping to make it an annual affair. Though the nature trust isn't as well known as other conservation groups like The NatureConservancy of Canada, she points out that her group of choice plays an important role, adding has protected 5,000 acres of land throughout the province. The concert is as much about raising awareness and drawing volunteers for the organizations as it is a celebration of great music. ""There are volunteers needed,"" she said. ""We do a lot of cleanups on the preserves, surveying lands for plants and animals. We need all the people we can get to help out.""

90704,743 words,The New York Times,"Section A; Page 17, Column 1; National Desk",E.P.A. Office Recommends Against Dam Project Near Denver,1990,"In a decision likely to rekindle the wrath of developers and their political supporters in the West, the Denver office of the Environmental Protection Agency formally recommended today that construction of a $1 billion dam project in Colorado be prohibited. The agency found that the proposed Two Forks Dam, intended to augment long-term water supplies for Denver and surrounding communities, would cause unacceptable environmental damage. It also concluded that more environmentally benign alternatives to the planned dam and reservoir were available. The recommendation upholds a preliminary decision made a year ago by William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the E.P.A., to veto the project. The 615-foot dam was to have been built on the South Platte River near its confluence with its North Fork, about 30 miles southwest of Denver. Although the population of Denver, now about half a million, has gone down in recent years, city and state officials say the dam is needed to accommodate growth over the next 40 years in the region, which has been gaining population. Environmentalists contend that the project would merely provide developers with the basis for more expansion by making more water supplies available, but in doing so would severely harm the flow of the already badly depleted Platte River. Earlier Decision Was Assailed Mr. Reilly's decision to bar the project was fiercely attacked by Western Republicans and criticized by John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, but President Bush did not overrule Mr. Reilly. The final decision on the fate of the Two Forks project is scheduled to be made within 60 days by LaJuana Wilcher, the E.P.A.'s assistant administrator for water, although an extension may be needed to review the 11,000 written comments that the agency has received, officials said. The environmental agency said that building the dam would inundate a ''unique and irreplaceable'' stretch of the South Platte that is rated as one of the nation's best trout fishing areas. It would also flood ''miles of extremely high-quality river, wetland and upland areas which are home to a diversity of wildlife, including deer, elk, bighorn sheep, wild turkeys, bald eagles, peregrine falcons and the endangered pawnee montane skipper butterfly.'' Bill Miller, manager of the Denver Water Department, said in a telephone interview that the environmental agency's decision ''means that a water storage project that Denver and 42 other political entitites in the Denver area have worked on for eight years at a cost of $40 million and for which we have gone through all the hoops required by the Federal Government has now been stopped.''  'Two Forks Is Not Dead' But William Van Schooneveld, chairman of the Metropolitan Water Providers, an association of water utilities, said: ''Despite statements by those who have opposed the project all along, Two Forks is not dead. We look forward to working with E.P.A. in solving a genunine and growing problem of insufficient water supplies for the next couple of decades in metropolitan Denver.'' Peter A. A. Berle, president of the NationalAudubonSociety, which has played a major role in opposing the project, said the decision ''was the only determination possible.'' He said the recommendation followed ''exhaustive scientific and legal review,'' adding, ''It is appropriate that this announcement is made at the same time that the nation's most spectacular wildlife event is occurring downstream on the Platte in central Nebraska, the annual migration of more than a half-million sandhill cranes and several million more ducks and geese.'' 'No Signs of Giving Up' Mr. Berle cautioned that the Two Forks project could ''rise from the dead'' through political pressure. ''The water developers show no signs of giving up this fight, as long as they can spend rate-payer dollars on high-priced lawyers and lobbyists,'' he said. The environmental office's recommendation to kill the project was made under the authority of the Clean Water Act by Lee DeHihns, an official from the E.P.A.'s Atlanta regional office. James J. Scherer, the agency's regional administrator in Denver, had asked to be excused from the review process because of his previous involvement in the issue. If Ms. Wilcher, the E.P.A. assistant administrator, upholds Mr. DeHihns's recommendation, the only other appeal open to the project's backers would be through the courts.","['has', 'play', 'oppos', 'said', 'was', 'said', 'follow', 'ad', 'is', 'is', 'mad', 'is', 'occur', 'giv', 'caut', 'ris', 'show', 'giv', 'spend', 'said']",127,20,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,"['oppos', 'said', 'said', 'said']",4,4
140288,657 words,Portland Press Herald (Maine),LOCAL & STATE; Pg. B1,Dirigo proposal stirs up concern; State House: Critics say a self-insured program offers no guarantee of additional cost savings.,2006,"Architects of a plan to convert DirigoChoice to a self-insured health insurance program had a hard time convincing skeptics Tuesday that the change would make the state program more affordable. Proponents of the idea reason that the program could recoup profits that would otherwise go to a commercial carrier. More savings could come from getting the best deals for insurance services. For example, wellness programs and claims management could be provided by different companies instead of a single insurer. But the argument didn't fly with critics, mostly business lobbyists and Republican members of the Insurance and Financial Services Committee, which held a public hearing on the proposal. At one point, committee member and gubernatorial candidate Sen. Peter Mills, R-Cornville, stormed out in disagreement. Critics contend that being self-insured does not guarantee savings. ""The answer does not lie in whether you are self-insured or fully insured, it has do with what the market is willing to offer,"" said Kevin Gildart, vice president of human resources at Bath Iron Works, which used to be self-insured. Others described the proposal as lacking legislative oversight and violating the promise of a public-private partnership. An- them Blue Cross Blue Shield has been the private carrier for the insurance program since January 2004. But Gov. John Baldacci, who made DirigoChoice a key part of his Dirigo Health reform plan, says he wants a viable option for the state in case it does not renew its contract with Anthem when it expires at year's end. Steven Tringale, the health care consultant hired earlier this year by the Baldacci administration, said that approving the proposal does not rule out the possibility that Maine may end up going with a commercial carrier. ""Quite frankly, if the insured option is the better option when we got the bids back . . . there's no reason for us not to continue an insured relationship,"" Tringale, who is managing director of Hinckley, Allen & Tringale in Boston, told lawmakers. That did little to appease lawmakers, who did not like the idea of transferring the risk of insuring DirigoChoice from a private carrier to the state. They said they feared that DirigoChoice enrollees could be hurt were the program to go bankrupt. ""Who is ultimately responsible for the bill?"" said Rep. Kevin Glynn, R-South Portland. The governor's office said enrollees are free of liability and that it will present clarifying language at a work session on the proposal next Tuesday. Katie Fullam-Harris, Anthem's lobbyist, expressed some comfort with what Tringale said, indicating that his comments had a less strident tenor than did remarks the governor made last week. Baldacci was quoted as saying he wanted to move to a self-insured system by Jan. 1. ""So we're hearing one thing and seeing and hearing on another side something different,"" said Fullam-Harris. Many of those who testified in support of the proposal - an amendment to an existing bill - were members of the MainePeople'sAlliance, a citizens group that has championed the expansion of DirigoChoice. John Henderson, a member of the alliance and a DirigoChoice enrollee, said allowing the state to self-insure would provide stability to the program and give Henderson, who has diabetes, peace of mind that he would have uninterrupted coverage. A back-and-forth between Henderson and Mills spoke to the deeper rifts on the tenets of DirigoChoice. ""Every citizen deserves health insurance, there's no excuse,"" said Henderson. Mills said he did not disagree, but ""my contention is it's driving more people outside the existing market than it is protecting."" As the discussion escalated, committee co-chair Sen. Nancy Sullivan, D-Biddeford, interrupted, saying, ""This is not a debate."" ""Well, it became one,"" Mills said before putting on his jacket and leaving the hearing room.

59022,838 words,Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News,STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS,Most of 85 pets taken from Shelby woman could find new homes,2011,"Sept. 07--SHELBY -- Carolyn Owens stands in her backyard, trying to blink back tears as she looks into an empty kennel, the door hanging ajar. ""I keep thinking it's a nightmare and I'm going to wake up and my dogs will be there,"" she said, rubbing tears from her eyes. She said her stomach is tied up in knots, her mind racing in a million different directions. ""This has just got totally, totally out of hand,"" Owens said. 85 animals Last week, Cleveland County Animal Control officers rounded up 48 dogs and 37 cats from the sheds and kennels on her property. Many of them had been living in the house. Sam Lockridge, Cleveland County health services coordinator, said the conditions inside the home were deplorable and the county attorney is working on an abatement order to have the house either cleaned up or destroyed. Owens has spent the past week packing up to move in with her son temporarily. For now, the yellow house on McBrayer Street Extension sits silent, baking in the September sun. A sheet of plywood boards up one window, while others are cracked with jagged holes in the glass. From outside, the smell of feces and urine emanates from the building. On Friday, Lockridge said Owens signed a waiver giving the county the right to take ownership of the dogs and cats. Now, county officials are working with humane societies and rescue groups around the state in an effort to save as many of them as possible. Rescue groups pitch in Marguerite Mebane, president of the Cleveland County HumaneSociety, has been working with the HumaneSociety of the United States and other groups to find homes for Owens' animals. She said so far, 11 dogs have been taken in by Mecklenburg Care and Control. ""They are a very large facility and they said they would have no problem placing these dogs,"" Mebane said. ""They handpicked which ones they wanted."" Two individual private rescue organizations from Union County have requested photos of more dogs and Mebane is waiting to hear back from a beagle rescue group. She said the Cleveland County HumaneSociety has taken in four kittens. ""We're hoping to still hear from a few other rescues,"" Mebane said. ""We're trying to get as many out as possible in the next two to three days."" Lockridge said he's allowing rescue groups and shelters to take as many of the pets as they have room for. The remaining dogs and cats will be evaluated by a vet, and then, if their temperament permits, will be put up for adoption. So far, only a few kittens, blinded from an infection of the eyes, have been euthanized. Lockridge said he will not release any of the pets back to Owens, and depending on the outcome of her court appearance, she could be restricted from owning animals in the future. According to an evaluation of several of the animals performed by Dr. Deanna Moseley of Hope Animal Hospital, the general condition of the dogs was poor. ""Many are thin and malnourished, while some are of better health,"" the statement read. The outside dogs were in better health and more socialized, according to Moseley. Some of the puppies, not yet a year old, were already pregnant. 'I tried to find homes for them' Owens said she knows she had too many pets. She said things snowballed until they got out of control. ""I definitely had too many animals,"" she said. ""I totally admit that. I tried to find homes for them. I was working to get them out of my house."" She said she started with 10 dogs when a male dog jumped a fence and got two females pregnant. The problem was exacerbated when she said the city of Shelby had to do some digging near her backyard to install sewer pipes and told her she had to take down the fence around her property. She said she was forced to bring more dogs inside the house. She said she tried to find a place for the animals at Petsmart and the HumaneSociety, but was told they either couldn't take in big dogs or they did not have room. ""There needs to be some type of service here in Cleveland County that people can go to get help when it's legitimate,"" Owens said. Living on a fixed income of less than $1,000 a month, her money didn't go far. She said making spaying/neutering more affordable would have helped. ""That's where the problem is,"" Owens said. ""Somebody needs to reduce some prices, with this economy the way it is."" Mebane said the HumaneSociety has a low-cost spay and neuter program called SNIP, which offers reduced rates. With SNIP, Mebane said the cost would run between $45 and $70, depending on the size of the animal while the cost for spaying and neutering at a vet's office would double or triple that price. ""She was just in way, way over her head,"" Mebane said. ""She had given away everything she had for these dogs and cats."" Owens said if it came down to feeding her pets or feeding herself, her animals would come first. ""I love these animals and these animals are my whole life,"" she said.

Every human needs clean water to survive. No one or no interest group should have the right or the leeway to pollute our wells and municipal water supplies. We have given farmers some slack because they produce food that is also necessary for a healthy nation. But there is one Big Agriculture endeavor that has nothing to do with food production and that is puppy mills. Lancaster city draws water from the Conestoga for thousands of municipal customers. That watershed (and every other one in the county) contains thousands of tons of dog feces spread on farmland by Lancaster County puppy mills. That waste is not manure. It is a highly contaminated source of parasites and pathogens that has undergone no treatment and threatens human health. When washed into our waterways, it not only pollutes due to its high nitrogen and phosphorus concentration, but also because it contains many diseases, some that can pass through water filters and are highly resistant to chlorine. Very serious illness can occur when a person ingests (in some cases, contacts or inhales) these pathogens in crops, soil or water contaminated with dog feces. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has many pages dedicated to educating doctors, veterinarians and the public of the transmission of zoonotic diseases from dog waste to humans. The Environmental Protection Agency gives out thousands of dollars of grants to states and municipalities to educate citizens that they should always clean up after their dogs, because dog waste is a significant contributor to water pollution and a human health hazard. You see the big contradiction here? Maybe the state Department of Agriculture needs to learn how to Google: CDC zoonotic transmission dog feces. Maybe the state Department of Environmental Protection should Bing: EPA dog waste. We don't eat dogs in this country, so why are they being included under livestock and given the same pollution protections as dairy cows? Not allowing this puppy mill pollution is a ""no brainer"" and a way to reduce the TMDL (total maximum daily load) for the Chesapeake Bay cleanup. I urge you to call state Sen. Mike Brubaker. His district contains over 100 puppy mills upstream of Lancaster city. He is chairman of the state Senate Agriculture Committee. See if the senator is for eliminating this large pollution problem by making it illegal for dog waste to be spread on our farmland, beside our waterways.

Statewide gatherings usually draw a mix of scientists, lay volunteers and leaders from the state's 50 regional chapters. A few lucky students will get to participate. The Audubon Society will provide scholarships for a small group of high school students, waiving the registration fee of $325. Eyzaguirre called the ""energy and enthusiasm"" of younger attendees a welcome complement to the experience of older attendees. Craig Hohenberger, who is president of the Monterey Peninsula Audubon Society and teaches at Carmel Valley Middle School, says birds are ""good indicators of environmental health""   an idea he tries to impress upon his students. But there are things people can do to improve that health, Eyzaguirre said. ""Anyone with a backyard can plant the right plants to provide a habitat for native birds and butterflies,"" she said. Sharing such ideas, said Eyzaguirre, is one of the most valuable features of the annual meeting, which provides a forum for chapters to share inspiration and information. A major source of pride and inspiration for California birders has been the revival of the California condor population. One talk will describe that success. After their near extinction in the 1980s, the last wild condor was captured and the birds were bred in captivity. Audubon California is now focused on efforts to ban lead bullets in condor habitat. A workshop early Tuesday will address efforts to prevent lead poisoning, which was recently identified by scientists at the University of California-Santa Cruz as a major cause of condor deaths. A bill that would implement such a ban is on Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's desk awaiting his signature or veto. Monterey County is a birdwatcher's paradise, said Hohenberger, hosting some 485 species. The variety of local habitat encourages species diversity, he said. For enthusiasts, sea and shore birds and songbirds are popular, as well as raptors and owls. Among the excursions assembly-goers will be treated to are a condor-viewing field trip, bird banding to identify birds, a whale and seabird tour, and morning bird walks.

175183,419 words,Buffalo News (New York),LOCAL; Pg. D3,DEC continues Olean Creek oil spill investigation; Agency response team dispatched to site after another report by citizens group,2012,"State environmental conservation officials are continuing to look into an oil spill in Olean Creek in Cattaraugus County. A spill response team was dispatched to the site after the Department of Environmental Conservation got the complaint March 27. The small amount was cleaned up, the DEC said. But several days after that, a citizens group again reported oil in the creek. The DEC is investigating the latest areas identified by Concerned Citizens of Cattaraugus County. Jacob Mumm, a member of the group, said he took photographs and videos of the oily sheen on the water. They can be seen at cattarauguswatermonitors.org/blakeslee. ""Their cleanup, as far as I can tell, was at the site of the spill,"" he said. Mumm said he believes oil has settled along the stream bank and edges of the stream. He said when someone steps into it or disturbs rocks, ""large quantities"" of oil are kicked up and coat the surface of the stream. ""You wouldn't see it if you were just looking at the bank,"" he said. The DEC received a complaint about oil in Olean Creek at Back Hinsdale Road near Blakeslee Hollow the afternoon of March 27, spokeswoman Megan Gollwitzer said in an email. DEC staff found an oily sheen and a small amount of a crude oil substance, believed to be five gallons or less, collecting in a tributary to Olean Creek, she said. ""DEC spill responders and minerals staff took initial measures to contain the spill by applying spill absorbent material in the affected area,"" Gollwitzer said. She said the efforts were successful and no long-term effects were projected as a result of the spill. Heavy rains made it difficult to identify the origin of the spill. DEC returned to the area March 28 and 30 to follow up on cleanup activities in that area. Spill responders also returned to inspect the area April 12 after receiving another complaint, and no oily sheens or spills were observed at that time. Mumm said he reported the sheen on April 11. He believes the area of contamination is at least one mile long. He is concerned because the intake pipe for the Olean water treatment plant is near the spill. The Concerned Citizens group is involved in the Water Sentinels program with the SierraClub. The group is keeping tabs on water quality in 10 streams to get baseline levels in the event hydraulic fracturing takes place in the area. Gollwitzer said the DEC will investigate the latest complaint ""to determine if further action is warranted and to take appropriate cleanup actions if needed."" email: bobrien@buffnews.com","['is', 'involv', 'is', 'keep', 'get', 'tak', 'said', 'investig', 'determin', 'is', 'war', 'tak', 'nee']",65,13,[],0,[],0,[],0,['investig'],1,[],0,[],0,[],0,['said'],1,2
87490,1215 words,Austin American-Statesman (Texas),MAIN; Pg. A01,Felling trees gives way to selling views,2007,"LUFKIN -The massive paper mill here that once made East Texas pine trees a major source of newsprint sits mothballed. Down the street, the heyday of the paper industry - long a stalwart of the East Texas economy - is remembered in a museum dedicated to Texas forestry. But as the paper and lumber industries wane - facing competition from overseas and the Internet and suffering from a downturn in the housing market - East Texas cities such as Lufkin have arrived at an unlikely option to buoy their economy: In a region that has depended on the extraction of natural resources, it is the preservation of those very resources that is driving the new, unexpected ecotourism industry. An environmental group is competing with oil and gas interests and private equity firms to snatch up the old timberland being abandoned by paper companies. Otherwise, ecotourism in these parts amounts largely to a marketing scheme, a brand called the Pineywoods Experience that's the brainchild of the environmental group, the Conservation Fund and a consulting outfit. Ecotourism, in a nutshell, is a kind of travel that prizes flora, fauna and cultural heritage, and which emphasizes preservation of the natural environment. Towns from Jefferson to Beaumont , eager to find an alternative to the industry that has so long shaped their economy, appear to be banding together and buying into the idea. At least 70 businesses, individuals and small governments have signed onto the plan, which has a $1.5 million budget, much of it raised by the Conservation Fund. For generations, East Texans have considered the paper and logging companies, such as Temple-Inland Inc. , to be benevolent corporate stewards, even as the mill in Lufkin caused a chemical stench that kept people indoors as far away as Nacogdoches, 20 miles away . In 2000 , about a half-dozen companies owned about a third of the 12 million forested acres in East Texas . ""They were the most intensive managers of forest land in the state; they could not afford to abuse their land or mismanage their lands,"" Tom Boggus , associate director for forest resource development and sustainable forestry with the Texas Forest Service. But by this summer, when Temple-Inland sold 1.55 million acres of timberland for $2.38 billion to a private equity firm, no land remained in the hands of the big paper companies, Boggus said. The future of the timberland, either as managed forest or subdivision, remains a question. The land could be turned into a ""sterile pine plantation,"" said Richard Donovan , the author of ""Paddling the Wild Neches,"" and, like many people in these parts, a former Temple-Inland employee. ""Seeking to maximize their profits, they go in and completely obliterate anything but pine trees, and plant them in rows just like you plant corn or cotton or anything else,"" he said. ""No wildlife will live in pine plantations - there's nothing for them to eat and no shelter for them. No sunlight reaches the floor of forest for flowers, shrubs or anything else."" The forest sector is still the top economic engine in 23 of East Texas' 43 counties , but its hold is slipping. In 2004, the Lufkin paper mill, which opened in May 1939 as the Southland Paper Mill, the first commercial pine pulp plant in the world, was shuttered by the Canadian company that now owns it. Five hundred and eighty people went jobless. Twenty years ago, Texas sported more than 300 active wood mills; today it has 116, according to Boggus. Thousands have lost their jobs. Conservation groups have urged the state and federal government to buy old timberland, but acquisition money has been hard to come by. So in the Lufkin convention center on a Wednesday morning in September, about three dozen townspeople, mayors and organizers convened to hear from Ted Eubanks, a Houston consultant who runs Fermata Inc., whose motto is ""The Business of Nature."" Much of the budget for the Pineywoods Experience project is going, for now, to building a Web site and paying Fermata, which has worked on building nature tourism strategies for communities across the country, from the Gulf Coast to Nebraska's Platte River. What they got was an old-fashioned sermon. ""If you believe East Texas is destined for second-class citizenship,"" he told his audience, ""I don't want you around. I believe it can compete."" Eubanks' plan, still short on details, calls for a Tides to Tall Timbers Adventure Trail, from Galveston up through Jefferson; the Texas Trail Towns route; and a revival of the Chautauqua, a 19th-century traveling roadshow. (""It was like Broadway come to town,"" he explained.) ""We can never replace the economy that was here,"" he says. ""East Texas has been a colonial economy for so long: We've shipped out timber, we've shipped out water, we've shipped out people. We want to engender a pride of place."" Sixty-six percent of the U.S. population is interested in environmentally responsible travel, according to a 2003 Tourism Industry Association of America report. Ecotourism, he says, ""is the right thing to do to preserve heritage, but equally important, it's good for business. You deplete this natural, historical landscape, you lose business. The sustainable future of East Texas depends on these resources."" While some spots in East Texas, like Caddo Lake and Jefferson , lure tourists, small towns get passed over, said Andy Jones, director of the Texas office of the Conservation Fund. TheConservationFund has purchased about 50,000 acres of East Texas land over the last few years. ""We're acquiring additional public land and then telling people to come out here,"" Julie Shackleford, Texas Programs Director of the Conservation Fund, said. Meanwhile, conservation interests are closely watching a struggle over the creation of the Neches River National Wildlife Refuge. In 2005, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service designated up to 25,000 acres on the upper Neches River for the Refuge, but the state Water Development board and the City of Dallas, which want to build a reservoir in that location, are now suing the Fish & Wildlife Service to block the agency from moving forward to acquire land for the refuge. At bottom, the ecotourism effort represents a cultural sea change in how East Texas regards its natural resources. ""People use the land as if it's an infinite resource,"" Carolyn Salter , mayor of Palestine, said. ""They cut all the trees off of it, and then the land erodes into the creek. Then they try to sell it. They think that's the thing to do because that's what always been done. It's a mentality of using land that doesn't include sustainable land practices."" The ecotourism effort is a way of developing new markets ""for keeping trees as trees,"" Boggus said. ""We're putting value in trees just as themselves, for their intrinsic value as wildlife habitat or as vistas or for clean water, not as a wood product,"" he said. In a report released last month, Environment Texas estimated that logging, mining and drilling jeopardize the $8.4 billion worth of activities in Texas' forests, such as fishing, hunting and wildlife watching. So much of East Texas has for so long been based on the forest industry, said Lufkin Mayor Jack Gorden . ""We're starting to see the forest for the trees,"" he said - and he meant it literally. asherprice@statesman.com; 445-3643","['has', 'purchas', 'wer', 'acquir', 'tel', 'com', 'said', 'ar', 'watch', 'riv']",60,10,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,['acquir'],1,[],0,['purchas'],1,"['com', 'said']",2,4
