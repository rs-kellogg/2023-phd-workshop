171631,431 words,The Telegraph-Journal (New Brunswick),MAIN; Pg. A3,Music festival to raise funds for nature trust,2012,"While living in Toronto and England, musician Kelly-Sue O'Connor yearned to be back home in gorgeous Albert County. After a 10-year separation, she arrived in the Hillsborough area two years ago, a relief from what she calls the concrete jungle. With a newborn baby, she settled down, found a job and volunteered with the Nature Trust Of New Brunswick. At the beginning of June, she set out to create a day-long music festival in Hillsborough to raise funds for the nature trust. In less than a month, with the help of a few friends, she had 12 bands signed up for the event and it's now ready to go. ""I'm so shocked at how fast it came together,"" said O'Connor. ""How fast everyone got on board. We have the bands, the sponsors; we have audio, the stage and lights."" The music marathon, called The Bore Music Festival, will be held at the town's Kiwanis building on July 28 and will feature some of the East Coast's finest folk-indie bands. The music will begin at noon and continue until midnight, all for a ticket cost of $24. ""I wanted to bring the music scene to me and this community and expose people to some great music,"" said O'Connor, who hails from Stoney Creek, about 10 kilometres north of Hillsborough. ""We have great bands on board and I'm looking forward to having a great time."" Headlining will be Paper Beat Scissors, also known as Halifax's Tim Crabtree. His music has received rave reviews across North America and he's a regular on CBC Radio 2. There's plenty of other talent to look forward to as well - from Lovestorm - duo Tim Isaac and Nina Khosla - to piano-infused folk-indie artist Zwerg from Moncton and bluegrass/folk musician Jens Jeppesen. The lineup has been handpicked by O'Connor herself. ""I wanted to actually like the music,"" she said. ""I wanted to mix in the folk-indie scene, have a singer-songwriter feel to it."" All the money will go back into the Nature Trust Of New Brunswick and enhancing nature in her own backyard. She's hoping to make it an annual affair. Though the nature trust isn't as well known as other conservation groups like The NatureConservancy of Canada, she points out that her group of choice plays an important role, adding has protected 5,000 acres of land throughout the province. The concert is as much about raising awareness and drawing volunteers for the organizations as it is a celebration of great music. ""There are volunteers needed,"" she said. ""We do a lot of cleanups on the preserves, surveying lands for plants and animals. We need all the people we can get to help out.""
