171631,431 words,The Telegraph-Journal (New Brunswick),MAIN; Pg. A3,Music festival to raise funds for nature trust,2012,"While living in Toronto and England, musician Kelly-Sue O'Connor yearned to be back home in gorgeous Albert County. After a 10-year separation, she arrived in the Hillsborough area two years ago, a relief from what she calls the concrete jungle. With a newborn baby, she settled down, found a job and volunteered with the Nature Trust Of New Brunswick. At the beginning of June, she set out to create a day-long music festival in Hillsborough to raise funds for the nature trust. In less than a month, with the help of a few friends, she had 12 bands signed up for the event and it's now ready to go. ""I'm so shocked at how fast it came together,"" said O'Connor. ""How fast everyone got on board. We have the bands, the sponsors; we have audio, the stage and lights."" The music marathon, called The Bore Music Festival, will be held at the town's Kiwanis building on July 28 and will feature some of the East Coast's finest folk-indie bands. The music will begin at noon and continue until midnight, all for a ticket cost of $24. ""I wanted to bring the music scene to me and this community and expose people to some great music,"" said O'Connor, who hails from Stoney Creek, about 10 kilometres north of Hillsborough. ""We have great bands on board and I'm looking forward to having a great time."" Headlining will be Paper Beat Scissors, also known as Halifax's Tim Crabtree. His music has received rave reviews across North America and he's a regular on CBC Radio 2. There's plenty of other talent to look forward to as well - from Lovestorm - duo Tim Isaac and Nina Khosla - to piano-infused folk-indie artist Zwerg from Moncton and bluegrass/folk musician Jens Jeppesen. The lineup has been handpicked by O'Connor herself. ""I wanted to actually like the music,"" she said. ""I wanted to mix in the folk-indie scene, have a singer-songwriter feel to it."" All the money will go back into the Nature Trust Of New Brunswick and enhancing nature in her own backyard. She's hoping to make it an annual affair. Though the nature trust isn't as well known as other conservation groups like The NatureConservancy of Canada, she points out that her group of choice plays an important role, adding has protected 5,000 acres of land throughout the province. The concert is as much about raising awareness and drawing volunteers for the organizations as it is a celebration of great music. ""There are volunteers needed,"" she said. ""We do a lot of cleanups on the preserves, surveying lands for plants and animals. We need all the people we can get to help out.""

90704,743 words,The New York Times,"Section A; Page 17, Column 1; National Desk",E.P.A. Office Recommends Against Dam Project Near Denver,1990,"In a decision likely to rekindle the wrath of developers and their political supporters in the West, the Denver office of the Environmental Protection Agency formally recommended today that construction of a $1 billion dam project in Colorado be prohibited. The agency found that the proposed Two Forks Dam, intended to augment long-term water supplies for Denver and surrounding communities, would cause unacceptable environmental damage. It also concluded that more environmentally benign alternatives to the planned dam and reservoir were available. The recommendation upholds a preliminary decision made a year ago by William K. Reilly, the Administrator of the E.P.A., to veto the project. The 615-foot dam was to have been built on the South Platte River near its confluence with its North Fork, about 30 miles southwest of Denver. Although the population of Denver, now about half a million, has gone down in recent years, city and state officials say the dam is needed to accommodate growth over the next 40 years in the region, which has been gaining population. Environmentalists contend that the project would merely provide developers with the basis for more expansion by making more water supplies available, but in doing so would severely harm the flow of the already badly depleted Platte River. Earlier Decision Was Assailed Mr. Reilly's decision to bar the project was fiercely attacked by Western Republicans and criticized by John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, but President Bush did not overrule Mr. Reilly. The final decision on the fate of the Two Forks project is scheduled to be made within 60 days by LaJuana Wilcher, the E.P.A.'s assistant administrator for water, although an extension may be needed to review the 11,000 written comments that the agency has received, officials said. The environmental agency said that building the dam would inundate a ''unique and irreplaceable'' stretch of the South Platte that is rated as one of the nation's best trout fishing areas. It would also flood ''miles of extremely high-quality river, wetland and upland areas which are home to a diversity of wildlife, including deer, elk, bighorn sheep, wild turkeys, bald eagles, peregrine falcons and the endangered pawnee montane skipper butterfly.'' Bill Miller, manager of the Denver Water Department, said in a telephone interview that the environmental agency's decision ''means that a water storage project that Denver and 42 other political entitites in the Denver area have worked on for eight years at a cost of $40 million and for which we have gone through all the hoops required by the Federal Government has now been stopped.''  'Two Forks Is Not Dead' But William Van Schooneveld, chairman of the Metropolitan Water Providers, an association of water utilities, said: ''Despite statements by those who have opposed the project all along, Two Forks is not dead. We look forward to working with E.P.A. in solving a genunine and growing problem of insufficient water supplies for the next couple of decades in metropolitan Denver.'' Peter A. A. Berle, president of the NationalAudubonSociety, which has played a major role in opposing the project, said the decision ''was the only determination possible.'' He said the recommendation followed ''exhaustive scientific and legal review,'' adding, ''It is appropriate that this announcement is made at the same time that the nation's most spectacular wildlife event is occurring downstream on the Platte in central Nebraska, the annual migration of more than a half-million sandhill cranes and several million more ducks and geese.'' 'No Signs of Giving Up' Mr. Berle cautioned that the Two Forks project could ''rise from the dead'' through political pressure. ''The water developers show no signs of giving up this fight, as long as they can spend rate-payer dollars on high-priced lawyers and lobbyists,'' he said. The environmental office's recommendation to kill the project was made under the authority of the Clean Water Act by Lee DeHihns, an official from the E.P.A.'s Atlanta regional office. James J. Scherer, the agency's regional administrator in Denver, had asked to be excused from the review process because of his previous involvement in the issue. If Ms. Wilcher, the E.P.A. assistant administrator, upholds Mr. DeHihns's recommendation, the only other appeal open to the project's backers would be through the courts.","['has', 'play', 'oppos', 'said', 'was', 'said', 'follow', 'ad', 'is', 'is', 'mad', 'is', 'occur', 'giv', 'caut', 'ris', 'show', 'giv', 'spend', 'said']",127,20,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,"['oppos', 'said', 'said', 'said']",4,4
140288,657 words,Portland Press Herald (Maine),LOCAL & STATE; Pg. B1,Dirigo proposal stirs up concern; State House: Critics say a self-insured program offers no guarantee of additional cost savings.,2006,"Architects of a plan to convert DirigoChoice to a self-insured health insurance program had a hard time convincing skeptics Tuesday that the change would make the state program more affordable. Proponents of the idea reason that the program could recoup profits that would otherwise go to a commercial carrier. More savings could come from getting the best deals for insurance services. For example, wellness programs and claims management could be provided by different companies instead of a single insurer. But the argument didn't fly with critics, mostly business lobbyists and Republican members of the Insurance and Financial Services Committee, which held a public hearing on the proposal. At one point, committee member and gubernatorial candidate Sen. Peter Mills, R-Cornville, stormed out in disagreement. Critics contend that being self-insured does not guarantee savings. ""The answer does not lie in whether you are self-insured or fully insured, it has do with what the market is willing to offer,"" said Kevin Gildart, vice president of human resources at Bath Iron Works, which used to be self-insured. Others described the proposal as lacking legislative oversight and violating the promise of a public-private partnership. An- them Blue Cross Blue Shield has been the private carrier for the insurance program since January 2004. But Gov. John Baldacci, who made DirigoChoice a key part of his Dirigo Health reform plan, says he wants a viable option for the state in case it does not renew its contract with Anthem when it expires at year's end. Steven Tringale, the health care consultant hired earlier this year by the Baldacci administration, said that approving the proposal does not rule out the possibility that Maine may end up going with a commercial carrier. ""Quite frankly, if the insured option is the better option when we got the bids back . . . there's no reason for us not to continue an insured relationship,"" Tringale, who is managing director of Hinckley, Allen & Tringale in Boston, told lawmakers. That did little to appease lawmakers, who did not like the idea of transferring the risk of insuring DirigoChoice from a private carrier to the state. They said they feared that DirigoChoice enrollees could be hurt were the program to go bankrupt. ""Who is ultimately responsible for the bill?"" said Rep. Kevin Glynn, R-South Portland. The governor's office said enrollees are free of liability and that it will present clarifying language at a work session on the proposal next Tuesday. Katie Fullam-Harris, Anthem's lobbyist, expressed some comfort with what Tringale said, indicating that his comments had a less strident tenor than did remarks the governor made last week. Baldacci was quoted as saying he wanted to move to a self-insured system by Jan. 1. ""So we're hearing one thing and seeing and hearing on another side something different,"" said Fullam-Harris. Many of those who testified in support of the proposal - an amendment to an existing bill - were members of the MainePeople'sAlliance, a citizens group that has championed the expansion of DirigoChoice. John Henderson, a member of the alliance and a DirigoChoice enrollee, said allowing the state to self-insure would provide stability to the program and give Henderson, who has diabetes, peace of mind that he would have uninterrupted coverage. A back-and-forth between Henderson and Mills spoke to the deeper rifts on the tenets of DirigoChoice. ""Every citizen deserves health insurance, there's no excuse,"" said Henderson. Mills said he did not disagree, but ""my contention is it's driving more people outside the existing market than it is protecting."" As the discussion escalated, committee co-chair Sen. Nancy Sullivan, D-Biddeford, interrupted, saying, ""This is not a debate."" ""Well, it became one,"" Mills said before putting on his jacket and leaving the hearing room.

59022,838 words,Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News,STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS,Most of 85 pets taken from Shelby woman could find new homes,2011,"Sept. 07--SHELBY -- Carolyn Owens stands in her backyard, trying to blink back tears as she looks into an empty kennel, the door hanging ajar. ""I keep thinking it's a nightmare and I'm going to wake up and my dogs will be there,"" she said, rubbing tears from her eyes. She said her stomach is tied up in knots, her mind racing in a million different directions. ""This has just got totally, totally out of hand,"" Owens said. 85 animals Last week, Cleveland County Animal Control officers rounded up 48 dogs and 37 cats from the sheds and kennels on her property. Many of them had been living in the house. Sam Lockridge, Cleveland County health services coordinator, said the conditions inside the home were deplorable and the county attorney is working on an abatement order to have the house either cleaned up or destroyed. Owens has spent the past week packing up to move in with her son temporarily. For now, the yellow house on McBrayer Street Extension sits silent, baking in the September sun. A sheet of plywood boards up one window, while others are cracked with jagged holes in the glass. From outside, the smell of feces and urine emanates from the building. On Friday, Lockridge said Owens signed a waiver giving the county the right to take ownership of the dogs and cats. Now, county officials are working with humane societies and rescue groups around the state in an effort to save as many of them as possible. Rescue groups pitch in Marguerite Mebane, president of the Cleveland County HumaneSociety, has been working with the HumaneSociety of the United States and other groups to find homes for Owens' animals. She said so far, 11 dogs have been taken in by Mecklenburg Care and Control. ""They are a very large facility and they said they would have no problem placing these dogs,"" Mebane said. ""They handpicked which ones they wanted."" Two individual private rescue organizations from Union County have requested photos of more dogs and Mebane is waiting to hear back from a beagle rescue group. She said the Cleveland County HumaneSociety has taken in four kittens. ""We're hoping to still hear from a few other rescues,"" Mebane said. ""We're trying to get as many out as possible in the next two to three days."" Lockridge said he's allowing rescue groups and shelters to take as many of the pets as they have room for. The remaining dogs and cats will be evaluated by a vet, and then, if their temperament permits, will be put up for adoption. So far, only a few kittens, blinded from an infection of the eyes, have been euthanized. Lockridge said he will not release any of the pets back to Owens, and depending on the outcome of her court appearance, she could be restricted from owning animals in the future. According to an evaluation of several of the animals performed by Dr. Deanna Moseley of Hope Animal Hospital, the general condition of the dogs was poor. ""Many are thin and malnourished, while some are of better health,"" the statement read. The outside dogs were in better health and more socialized, according to Moseley. Some of the puppies, not yet a year old, were already pregnant. 'I tried to find homes for them' Owens said she knows she had too many pets. She said things snowballed until they got out of control. ""I definitely had too many animals,"" she said. ""I totally admit that. I tried to find homes for them. I was working to get them out of my house."" She said she started with 10 dogs when a male dog jumped a fence and got two females pregnant. The problem was exacerbated when she said the city of Shelby had to do some digging near her backyard to install sewer pipes and told her she had to take down the fence around her property. She said she was forced to bring more dogs inside the house. She said she tried to find a place for the animals at Petsmart and the HumaneSociety, but was told they either couldn't take in big dogs or they did not have room. ""There needs to be some type of service here in Cleveland County that people can go to get help when it's legitimate,"" Owens said. Living on a fixed income of less than $1,000 a month, her money didn't go far. She said making spaying/neutering more affordable would have helped. ""That's where the problem is,"" Owens said. ""Somebody needs to reduce some prices, with this economy the way it is."" Mebane said the HumaneSociety has a low-cost spay and neuter program called SNIP, which offers reduced rates. With SNIP, Mebane said the cost would run between $45 and $70, depending on the size of the animal while the cost for spaying and neutering at a vet's office would double or triple that price. ""She was just in way, way over her head,"" Mebane said. ""She had given away everything she had for these dogs and cats."" Owens said if it came down to feeding her pets or feeding herself, her animals would come first. ""I love these animals and these animals are my whole life,"" she said.

Every human needs clean water to survive. No one or no interest group should have the right or the leeway to pollute our wells and municipal water supplies. We have given farmers some slack because they produce food that is also necessary for a healthy nation. But there is one Big Agriculture endeavor that has nothing to do with food production and that is puppy mills. Lancaster city draws water from the Conestoga for thousands of municipal customers. That watershed (and every other one in the county) contains thousands of tons of dog feces spread on farmland by Lancaster County puppy mills. That waste is not manure. It is a highly contaminated source of parasites and pathogens that has undergone no treatment and threatens human health. When washed into our waterways, it not only pollutes due to its high nitrogen and phosphorus concentration, but also because it contains many diseases, some that can pass through water filters and are highly resistant to chlorine. Very serious illness can occur when a person ingests (in some cases, contacts or inhales) these pathogens in crops, soil or water contaminated with dog feces. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has many pages dedicated to educating doctors, veterinarians and the public of the transmission of zoonotic diseases from dog waste to humans. The Environmental Protection Agency gives out thousands of dollars of grants to states and municipalities to educate citizens that they should always clean up after their dogs, because dog waste is a significant contributor to water pollution and a human health hazard. You see the big contradiction here? Maybe the state Department of Agriculture needs to learn how to Google: CDC zoonotic transmission dog feces. Maybe the state Department of Environmental Protection should Bing: EPA dog waste. We don't eat dogs in this country, so why are they being included under livestock and given the same pollution protections as dairy cows? Not allowing this puppy mill pollution is a ""no brainer"" and a way to reduce the TMDL (total maximum daily load) for the Chesapeake Bay cleanup. I urge you to call state Sen. Mike Brubaker. His district contains over 100 puppy mills upstream of Lancaster city. He is chairman of the state Senate Agriculture Committee. See if the senator is for eliminating this large pollution problem by making it illegal for dog waste to be spread on our farmland, beside our waterways.

Statewide gatherings usually draw a mix of scientists, lay volunteers and leaders from the state's 50 regional chapters. A few lucky students will get to participate. The Audubon Society will provide scholarships for a small group of high school students, waiving the registration fee of $325. Eyzaguirre called the ""energy and enthusiasm"" of younger attendees a welcome complement to the experience of older attendees. Craig Hohenberger, who is president of the Monterey Peninsula Audubon Society and teaches at Carmel Valley Middle School, says birds are ""good indicators of environmental health""   an idea he tries to impress upon his students. But there are things people can do to improve that health, Eyzaguirre said. ""Anyone with a backyard can plant the right plants to provide a habitat for native birds and butterflies,"" she said. Sharing such ideas, said Eyzaguirre, is one of the most valuable features of the annual meeting, which provides a forum for chapters to share inspiration and information. A major source of pride and inspiration for California birders has been the revival of the California condor population. One talk will describe that success. After their near extinction in the 1980s, the last wild condor was captured and the birds were bred in captivity. Audubon California is now focused on efforts to ban lead bullets in condor habitat. A workshop early Tuesday will address efforts to prevent lead poisoning, which was recently identified by scientists at the University of California-Santa Cruz as a major cause of condor deaths. A bill that would implement such a ban is on Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's desk awaiting his signature or veto. Monterey County is a birdwatcher's paradise, said Hohenberger, hosting some 485 species. The variety of local habitat encourages species diversity, he said. For enthusiasts, sea and shore birds and songbirds are popular, as well as raptors and owls. Among the excursions assembly-goers will be treated to are a condor-viewing field trip, bird banding to identify birds, a whale and seabird tour, and morning bird walks.

D3,DEC continues Olean Creek oil spill investigation; Agency response team dispatched to site after another report by citizens group,2012,"State environmental conservation officials are continuing to look into an oil spill in Olean Creek in Cattaraugus County. A spill response team was dispatched to the site after the Department of Environmental Conservation got the complaint March 27. The small amount was cleaned up, the DEC said. But several days after that, a citizens group again reported oil in the creek. The DEC is investigating the latest areas identified by Concerned Citizens of Cattaraugus County. Jacob Mumm, a member of the group, said he took photographs and videos of the oily sheen on the water. They can be seen at cattarauguswatermonitors.org/blakeslee. ""Their cleanup, as far as I can tell, was at the site of the spill,"" he said. Mumm said he believes oil has settled along the stream bank and edges of the stream. He said when someone steps into it or disturbs rocks, ""large quantities"" of oil are kicked up and coat the surface of the stream. ""You wouldn't see it if you were just looking at the bank,"" he said. The DEC received a complaint about oil in Olean Creek at Back Hinsdale Road near Blakeslee Hollow the afternoon of March 27, spokeswoman Megan Gollwitzer said in an email. DEC staff found an oily sheen and a small amount of a crude oil substance, believed to be five gallons or less, collecting in a tributary to Olean Creek, she said. ""DEC spill responders and minerals staff took initial measures to contain the spill by applying spill absorbent material in the affected area,"" Gollwitzer said. She said the efforts were successful and no long-term effects were projected as a result of the spill. Heavy rains made it difficult to identify the origin of the spill. DEC returned to the area March 28 and 30 to follow up on cleanup activities in that area. Spill responders also returned to inspect the area April 12 after receiving another complaint, and no oily sheens or spills were observed at that time. Mumm said he reported the sheen on April 11. He believes the area of contamination is at least one mile long. He is concerned because the intake pipe for the Olean water treatment plant is near the spill. The Concerned Citizens group is involved in the Water Sentinels program with the SierraClub. The group is keeping tabs on water quality in 10 streams to get baseline levels in the event hydraulic fracturing takes place in the area. Gollwitzer said the DEC will investigate the latest complaint ""to determine if further action is warranted and to take appropriate cleanup actions if needed."" email: bobrien@buffnews.com","['is', 'involv', 'is', 'keep', 'get', 'tak', 'said', 'investig', 'determin', 'is', 'war', 'tak', 'nee']",65,13,[],0,[],0,[],0,['investig'],1,[],0,[],0,[],0,['said'],1,2
87490,1215 words,Austin American-Statesman (Texas),MAIN; Pg. A01,Felling trees gives way to selling views,2007,"LUFKIN -The massive paper mill here that once made East Texas pine trees a major source of newsprint sits mothballed. Down the street, the heyday of the paper industry - long a stalwart of the East Texas economy - is remembered in a museum dedicated to Texas forestry. But as the paper and lumber industries wane - facing competition from overseas and the Internet and suffering from a downturn in the housing market - East Texas cities such as Lufkin have arrived at an unlikely option to buoy their economy: In a region that has depended on the extraction of natural resources, it is the preservation of those very resources that is driving the new, unexpected ecotourism industry. An environmental group is competing with oil and gas interests and private equity firms to snatch up the old timberland being abandoned by paper companies. Otherwise, ecotourism in these parts amounts largely to a marketing scheme, a brand called the Pineywoods Experience that's the brainchild of the environmental group, the Conservation Fund and a consulting outfit. Ecotourism, in a nutshell, is a kind of travel that prizes flora, fauna and cultural heritage, and which emphasizes preservation of the natural environment. Towns from Jefferson to Beaumont , eager to find an alternative to the industry that has so long shaped their economy, appear to be banding together and buying into the idea. At least 70 businesses, individuals and small governments have signed onto the plan, which has a $1.5 million budget, much of it raised by the Conservation Fund. For generations, East Texans have considered the paper and logging companies, such as Temple-Inland Inc. , to be benevolent corporate stewards, even as the mill in Lufkin caused a chemical stench that kept people indoors as far away as Nacogdoches, 20 miles away . In 2000 , about a half-dozen companies owned about a third of the 12 million forested acres in East Texas . ""They were the most intensive managers of forest land in the state; they could not afford to abuse their land or mismanage their lands,"" Tom Boggus , associate director for forest resource development and sustainable forestry with the Texas Forest Service. But by this summer, when Temple-Inland sold 1.55 million acres of timberland for $2.38 billion to a private equity firm, no land remained in the hands of the big paper companies, Boggus said. The future of the timberland, either as managed forest or subdivision, remains a question. The land could be turned into a ""sterile pine plantation,"" said Richard Donovan , the author of ""Paddling the Wild Neches,"" and, like many people in these parts, a former Temple-Inland employee. ""Seeking to maximize their profits, they go in and completely obliterate anything but pine trees, and plant them in rows just like you plant corn or cotton or anything else,"" he said. ""No wildlife will live in pine plantations - there's nothing for them to eat and no shelter for them. No sunlight reaches the floor of forest for flowers, shrubs or anything else."" The forest sector is still the top economic engine in 23 of East Texas' 43 counties , but its hold is slipping. In 2004, the Lufkin paper mill, which opened in May 1939 as the Southland Paper Mill, the first commercial pine pulp plant in the world, was shuttered by the Canadian company that now owns it. Five hundred and eighty people went jobless. Twenty years ago, Texas sported more than 300 active wood mills; today it has 116, according to Boggus. Thousands have lost their jobs. Conservation groups have urged the state and federal government to buy old timberland, but acquisition money has been hard to come by. So in the Lufkin convention center on a Wednesday morning in September, about three dozen townspeople, mayors and organizers convened to hear from Ted Eubanks, a Houston consultant who runs Fermata Inc., whose motto is ""The Business of Nature."" Much of the budget for the Pineywoods Experience project is going, for now, to building a Web site and paying Fermata, which has worked on building nature tourism strategies for communities across the country, from the Gulf Coast to Nebraska's Platte River. What they got was an old-fashioned sermon. ""If you believe East Texas is destined for second-class citizenship,"" he told his audience, ""I don't want you around. I believe it can compete."" Eubanks' plan, still short on details, calls for a Tides to Tall Timbers Adventure Trail, from Galveston up through Jefferson; the Texas Trail Towns route; and a revival of the Chautauqua, a 19th-century traveling roadshow. (""It was like Broadway come to town,"" he explained.) ""We can never replace the economy that was here,"" he says. ""East Texas has been a colonial economy for so long: We've shipped out timber, we've shipped out water, we've shipped out people. We want to engender a pride of place."" Sixty-six percent of the U.S. population is interested in environmentally responsible travel, according to a 2003 Tourism Industry Association of America report. Ecotourism, he says, ""is the right thing to do to preserve heritage, but equally important, it's good for business. You deplete this natural, historical landscape, you lose business. The sustainable future of East Texas depends on these resources."" While some spots in East Texas, like Caddo Lake and Jefferson , lure tourists, small towns get passed over, said Andy Jones, director of the Texas office of the Conservation Fund. TheConservationFund has purchased about 50,000 acres of East Texas land over the last few years. ""We're acquiring additional public land and then telling people to come out here,"" Julie Shackleford, Texas Programs Director of the Conservation Fund, said. Meanwhile, conservation interests are closely watching a struggle over the creation of the Neches River National Wildlife Refuge. In 2005, the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service designated up to 25,000 acres on the upper Neches River for the Refuge, but the state Water Development board and the City of Dallas, which want to build a reservoir in that location, are now suing the Fish & Wildlife Service to block the agency from moving forward to acquire land for the refuge. At bottom, the ecotourism effort represents a cultural sea change in how East Texas regards its natural resources. ""People use the land as if it's an infinite resource,"" Carolyn Salter , mayor of Palestine, said. ""They cut all the trees off of it, and then the land erodes into the creek. Then they try to sell it. They think that's the thing to do because that's what always been done. It's a mentality of using land that doesn't include sustainable land practices."" The ecotourism effort is a way of developing new markets ""for keeping trees as trees,"" Boggus said. ""We're putting value in trees just as themselves, for their intrinsic value as wildlife habitat or as vistas or for clean water, not as a wood product,"" he said. In a report released last month, Environment Texas estimated that logging, mining and drilling jeopardize the $8.4 billion worth of activities in Texas' forests, such as fishing, hunting and wildlife watching. So much of East Texas has for so long been based on the forest industry, said Lufkin Mayor Jack Gorden . ""We're starting to see the forest for the trees,"" he said - and he meant it literally. asherprice@statesman.com; 445-3643","['has', 'purchas', 'wer', 'acquir', 'tel', 'com', 'said', 'ar', 'watch', 'riv']",60,10,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,['acquir'],1,[],0,['purchas'],1,"['com', 'said']",2,4

Chapnick et al,2013,"United States District Court Eastern District of California has issued the following order: UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA ANATOLY KADOSHNIKOV, Plaintiff, v. ROBERT CHAPNICK, et al., Defendants. _____________________________________/ Case No. 1:13-cv-01071-LJO-SKO PC SECOND ORDER DENYING MOTIONS FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL (Docs. 19 and 20)  Plaintiff Anatoly Kadoshnikov, a state prisoner proceeding pro se and in forma pauperis, filed this civil rights action pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1983 on April 15, 2013, and it was transferred to the Fresno Division of the Eastern District of California on July 12, 2013, via order filed June 25, 2013. (Docs. 1, 9, 10.) This action involves past medical care issues at Avenal State Prison. On August 19, 2013, Plaintiff filed two more motions seeking the appointment of counsel, both of which contain representations regarding Plaintiff's current conditions of confinement and his health care issues. With respect to Plaintiff's current conditions of confinement, Plaintiff is incarcerated at the California Institution for Men (CIM) in Chino.1 Venue for any federal civil rights claims arising from conditions at that prison is proper in the Central District of California. 28 U.S.C.  1391(b). 1 Although Plaintiff expresses concern over transfer back to a prison in the Central Valley of California, he remains at CIM to date. Case 1:13-cv-01071-LJO-SKO Document 21 Filed 08/22/13 Page 1 of 3 2 As Plaintiff was previously informed, the Court does not have jurisdiction over prison officials at CIM. Zepeda v. United States Immigration Service, 753 F.2d 719, 727 (9th Cir. 1985). The Court is not without sympathy to the fact that Plaintiff is concerned about his conditions of confinement, but those issues may not be litigated in this case, Summers v. EarthIslandInstitute, 555 U.S. 488, 493, 129 S.Ct. 1142, 1149 (2009); Lujan v. DefendersofWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 559-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (1992); Mayfield v. United States, 599 F.3d 964, 969 (9th Cir. 2010), and the Court cannot provide Plaintiff with legal advice regarding redress for those issues, Pliler v. Ford, 5452 U.S. 225, 231, 124 S.Ct. 2441, 2446 (2004). Turning to Plaintiff's request for counsel, Plaintiff does not have a constitutional right to the appointment of counsel in this action. Palmer v. Valdez, 560 F.3d 965, 970 (9th Cir. 2009); Storseth v. Spellman, 654 F.2d 1349, 1353 (9th Cir. 1981). The Court may request the voluntary assistance of counsel pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  1915(e)(1), but it will do so only if exceptional circumstances exist. Palmer, 560 F.3d at 970; Wilborn v. Escalderon, 789 F.2d 1328, 1331 (9th Cir. 1986). In making this determination, the Court must evaluate the likelihood of success on the merits and the ability of Plaintiff to articulate his claims pro se in light of the complexity of the legal issues involved. Palmer, 560 F.3d at 970 (citation and quotation marks omitted); Wilborn, 789 F.2d at 1331. Neither consideration is dispositive and they must be viewed together. Palmer, 560 F.3d at 970 (citation and quotation marks omitted); Wilborn 789 F.2d at 1331. In the present case, the Court does not find the required exceptional circumstances. Even if it is assumed that Plaintiff is not well versed in the law and that he has made serious allegations which, if proved, would entitle him to relief, his case is not exceptional. The Court is faced with similar cases almost daily. Further, at this early stage in the proceedings, the Court cannot make a determination that Plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits, and based on a review of the record in this case, the Court does not find that Plaintiff cannot adequately articulate his claims. Id. While the Court recognizes that Plaintiff is at a disadvantage due to his pro se status and his incarceration, the test is not whether Plaintiff would benefit from the appointment of counsel. See Wilborn, 789 F.2d at 1331 (""Most actions require development of further facts during litigation /// Case 1:13-cv-01071-LJO-SKO Document 21 Filed 08/22/13 Page 2 of 3 3 and a pro se litigant will seldom be in a position to investigate easily the facts necessary to support the case."") The test is whether exceptional circumstances exist and here, they do not. Accordingly, Plaintiff's motions for the appointment of counsel, filed on August 19, 2013, are HEREBY DENIED.

29642,644 words,Portland Press Herald (Maine),LOCAL & STATE; Pg. B1,Families have toys tested for toxins; Participating parents welcome the opportunity for their kids' playthings to receive a safety check.,2007,"Seventeen-month-old Jackson Cleveland looked anxiously from his mother's arms as one of his favorite toys, a little yellow school bus, was tested for lead and other toxic chemicals. It was not good news when the test showed that the toy contained bromine, a chemical that isn't allowed in European toys, and levels of lead exceeding those recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. ''It is nerve-wracking. I guess it's going to have to be thrown away,'' said Jackson's mother, Patience Cleveland of Falmouth. The Clevelands and other families showed up at the Children's Museum of Maine on Wednesday to have their toys tested by the Alliance for a Clean and Healthy Maine, a coalition of groups that supports government regulation of toxic chemicals in toys. The event was held to publicize the launch of an online list of 1,200 children's products that have been tested by a national environmental coalition, led by the EcologyCenter of Ann Arbor, Mich. The tests showed that 35 percent contain lead, 47 percent are made with chemicals that likely contain hormone-disrupting phthalates, and 3 percent contain cadmium, a toxic metal, according to the coalition. ''Parents are left to decide what is safe and not safe,'' said Matt Prindiville, a toxic-policy advocate for the Natural Resources Council of Maine. While some toy industry groups expressed skepticism about the test results, parents who turned out at the museum on Wednesday, during the height of the holiday toy-buying season, said they welcomed the testing, especially considering this year's recalls of toys from China that were found to contain lead. The tests were done with a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer - a hand-held device about the size of a hair dryer - which identifies the composition of materials on the surface of products, said Kristine Jenkins of the Environmental Health Strategy Center in Portland, who conducted the tests. Many of the parents had read about the testing on a local Web site, momtomomofme.org. David Adams, a retired physician from Yarmouth, said that even low-level exposure to toxic chemicals can have lifelong effects. ''Getting toxic chemicals out of children's toys is a moral and medical imperative,'' Adams said. Cheryl Denis of Portland brought in a bag of toys belonging to her daughters, Ella, 3, and Lily, 11 months, who was gumming away on a wooden toy. Denis said she worries about the chemicals in plastics. ''I generally don't have a lot of plastic in my house, but you can't avoid it,'' she said. Carey Rosco of Cape Elizabeth brought in some figures, toy dishes and play sets that belong to her children, Zale, 7, Jenny, 5, and Amy, 3. Zale said he wouldn't be concerned if his once-treasured play set was found to be toxic, because it was no longer among his favorite toys. ''Not at all,'' he said. Some owners of toy stores in Maine said they had not checked out the new online toy list but they would welcome more regulation of the industry. Jane Letson, who owns the Apple Bee Company toy store in Portland, said the list will be useful to parents who have questions about how and where products are manufactured. ''It would be very helpful for parents to at least have a place to go,'' said Letson. Kathleen McHugh, executive director of the American Specialty Toy Retailing Association in Chicago, said her group supports regulation to make toys safe, but she is concerned about the accuracy of the coalition's tests. ''From what I understand, they used hand-held testing devices that have been proven to be inaccurate,'' said McHugh. She said the problem of toxic chemicals in toys is the result of the conditioning of consumers to buy cheap products at the expense of quality. ''The price of the toys gets pushed down. So do the manufacturing standards,'' she said.

146657,371 words,Aberdeen Press and Journal,BUSINESS; FARM/FOOD; News; Pg. 12,Europe faces honey of a problem over GM materials,2011,"EUROPEAN moves to reform rules on genetically modified crops appeared in disarray last night after a court ruled that honey containing pollen from a biotech maize variety required special authorisation before it can be sold. Scottish MEP Alyn Smith said the European Court of Justice ruling highlighted the legal mess Europe now found itself in over GM. He called on the European Commission to revoke a recent decision to allow small quantities of unauthorised GM materials into the EU in animal feeds. It had previously taken a zero-tolerance approach to GM contamination, regularly ordering entire shipments of imported feed supplies back to their ports of origin if they were found to have traces of biotech varieties not approved for use in the EU. The ruling followed a demand for compensation by some Bavarian beekeepers in Germany from their regional government which was growing a GM maize for research purposes. They had their hives close to the fields where the Monsanto-bred maize, MON810, was being tested. The GM maize was authorised for cultivation, but the honey from its pollen was not cleared for use. Environmentalists welcomed the court's decision. They said it would force the EC to strengthen its rules on unauthorised GM material. victory FriendsoftheEarth Europe spokesman Mute Schimpf said: ""This is a victory for beekeepers, consumers and the movement for GM-free agriculture in Europe. ""This ruling rewrites the rule book and gives legal backing to stronger measures to prevent contamination from the likes of Monsanto."" Mr Smith said: ""This ruling clearly underlines the need for EU regulation that would protect farmers, food producers and consumers against contamination of their products from GM cultivation. ""Zero tolerance must mean just that - traces of GMs, no matter how small, cannot be tolerated. The European Commission should revise its GM legislation to take account of the interests of consumers and food producers, and not the biotech industry."" Mr Smith said he believed the ruling could have far-reaching consequences, particularly for honey imported into the EU from nations where GM crops are grown. He added: ""This case is proof that co-existence (of GM and conventional crops) is a fallacy.""","['europ', 'said', 'is', 'rewrit', 'giv', 'prev', 'said', 'rul', 'underlin', 'protect', 'mean', 'be', 'tol']",88,13,[],0,['prev'],1,['prev'],1,[],0,[],0,[],0,['protect'],1,"['said', 'said']",2,5
85189,572 words,The Bismarck Tribune,DAKOTA WIRE; Pg. 1B,Hoeven denies DU bid to buy land in Kidder County,2009,"Gov. John Hoeven has blocked the proposed purchase of a 600-acre tract of land in Kidder County by DucksUnlimited. In a letter to DU dated Feb. 12, Hoeven said the Natural Areas Acquisition Committee recommended denying the purchase, citing a lack of public benefit as well as opposition from the Kidder County Commission. The advisory committee met in late January and voted 6-2 to reject DU's plan to buy the land from Judith Hetletved, 87. Ag Commissioner Roger Johnson said at that meeting in most cases, the advisory group follows the recommendation of the local entity involved - the county commission, in this case. He said there was nothing unique about the land that would warrant special consideration, a point echoed in Hoeven's letter. Hoeven also stated that North Dakota law generally prohibits corporations from owning agricultural land, and he did not find enough evidence to depart from that policy. Hoeven did, however, offer DU a compromise. Don Canton, spokesman for Hoeven, said the governor met with DU after the committee meeting and suggested a 30-year easement on the land rather than a perpetual easement. The land consists of 317 acres of prairie, 189 acres of cropland that is enrolled in the CRP program through 2012 and 112 acres of wetlands. Steve Adair, director of DU's regional office in Bismarck, said the state's corporate farming law is unfair to landowners and conservation groups like DucksUnlimited. ""The landowner, Mrs. Hetletved, should be allowed to sell this land to whomever she wants,"" Adair said. ""No harm to the state would be caused by DU owning this property. We pay taxes on our land, manage it well and keep it in grass-based agriculture by renting it out to local ranchers."" Jim Ringelman, DU's regional director for conservation, said the group's plan was to remove several old buildings from the land that could harbor rodents and other animals, and hold the land for three to four years as other work to rehabilitate the grassland and wetlands was completed. He said the land would have been eventually sold with permanent easements in place though the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services that would have protected the wetlands and prairie. Ringelman added that DU rolls over the capital from such sales to purchase other areas where the land is of marginal agricultural value. DU had offered a purchase price of $560 per acre. He said in the case of the Hetletved land, it's prime nesting habitat for waterfowl and other wildlife. ""You have to have uses for land like this,"" he said. Canton said he was unsure why DU turned down Hoeven's suggestion on the 30-year easement. ""The governor sought to find some common ground with them,"" Canton said. He said Hoeven has been a leader when it comes to conservation issues, saying it was under his administration the 1 million acres of public land in the PLOTS initiative came to fruition. ""That's a clear demonstration of the governor's commitment to conservation,"" Canton said. ""He offered a reasonable compromise."" Ringelman said from DU's perspective, it was business decision, pure and simple. He said 30-year easements are almost as costly as perpetual easements, and down the road, DU would be looking at going through the same process again, at a higher cost. ""Our members look closely at how we spend our money,"" he said. ""It would have been a bad business decision for us.""

165935,684 words,St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota),LOCAL; Pg. 1B,Proposed sales of U.S. land opposed; Forest Service urged to find other ways of subsidizing schools,2006,"For sale: 80 acres of prime, wooded real estate just inside a Minnesota state park. Will sell at market value. That ad hasn't been placed yet, and it wouldn't be worded quite that way. But there could be bids if the federal government goes ahead with a proposed sale of more than 300,000 acres of national forest land, including 2,622 acres owned by the Superior National Forest in northeastern Minnesota. Seventy parcels have been proposed for sale in Minnesota, including an 80-acre site just inside the eastern border of Judge C.R. Magney State Park and two parcels totaling 120 acres just outside the park's borders. The other 67 chunks are scattered throughout the northeast, with one near Voyageurs National Park. The federal government wants to sell the land to raise $800 million to fund a five-year extension of the Secure Rural Schools Act, which helps pay for roads and schools in rural areas. Because the Forest Service has limited authority to sell forest system land, Congress would first have to endorse the proposal, an action that is not at all assured. Under the proposal, local, state and tribal governments and nonprofit land-trust groups would be given first rights to buy parcels at market value, according to the Forest Service. If they choose not to, others could submit bids. ""The reality is lots of state and local governments don't have cash on hand for land purchases of this sort,'' said Kevin Proescholdt, wilderness and public lands program director for the IzaakWaltonLeagueofAmerica. ""Nor do lots of nonprofits."" Environmental groups such as the Izaak Walton League have criticized the proposed sale of public land, saying better ways should be found to pay for rural schools. Last week, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources added its opposition. ""The DNR recommends no public sale,"" according to a letter the agency sent to the Forest Service. ""The State of Minnesota or appropriate counties should have the first opportunity to acquire these lands through exchange or purchase if disposal becomes necessary."" Jim Willford, the DNR's regional state parks manager for northeastern Minnesota, said the agency took a detailed look at the parcels before reaching that conclusion. ""Most, if not all, of them fit into management units of state and county lands,"" Willford said. ""If they want to divest themselves of them, we would suggest it would be good to sit down and work through a number of options for transfer of the lands."" The DNR is especially concerned that the federal land inside Magney State Park could be sold to private interests and developed, said Willford, who added that the agency prefers the Forest Service simply retain all of the parcels. Barb Soderberg, a spokeswoman for Superior National Forest, said the scattered 40- to 80-acre parcels are separated from other blocks of federal forest and, accordingly, have a lower priority. Although owned by Superior National Forest, 58 of 70 are actually outside its defined borders. ""They just aren't next to any other Forest Service land, so historically they have been identified as parcels to trade out of as the opportunity to arose,'' Soderberg said. ""They are very isolated and difficult to manage.'' Proescholdt, however, said only four parcels do not appear to be connected to other publicly owned land. ""Those lands provide great values for the public and the ecosystem,"" she said. ""It doesn't make sense for us to fragment the public land ownership by selling off these parcels. Chances are they would be sold to private parties. That could mean seasonal cabins and homes, roads punched in to provide access, and it would further lead to fragmented forest landscapes up there.''

150314,690 words,Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News,LIFESTYLE,Wildlife addition retraces our outdoor heritage,2010,"Aug. 07--LAKE LILLIAN -- The first surveyors in southern Kandiyohi County scribbled in their notes that they could not take 100 steps in any direction without getting their feet wet. Those who enjoy the outdoors for hunting or wildlife observing today have an opportunity to retrace many of those steps in the area south of Big Kandiyohi Lake near Lake Lillian. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, with help from state and local conservation groups, acquired an 80-acre tract from a former Kandiyohi County family to expand the complex of wetlands and grasslands in the area for public use. The addition expands the Big Kandi Waterfowl Production Area (761 acres) and the Lake Lillian WPA (312 acres) to provide a complex of 1,183 acres, according to information at the July 26 dedication ceremony hosted at the site. There are also private, Re-Invest in Minnesota conservation lands nearby. It will now be possible for ambitious pheasant hunters to walk a four-mile stretch from one corner of the Big Kandi WPA complex to the other, according to Scott Glup with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Litchfield Wetland Management District. Unlike the early day surveyors, autumn pheasant hunters should be able to keep their feet dry, too. Many of the restored wetlands in this complex are seasonal, and provide ideal habitat for waterfowl in the spring while holding cover for upland birds in the fall. The recent acquisition represents a new focus by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to expand existing habitat areas when possible in preference to acquiring smaller, scattered tracts of land. Research shows that wildlife does much better when there are larger tracts of habitat, explained Glup. ""We're getting a very, very nice complex here,'' said Glup. No one probably knows this better than Wayne Coil, who grew up on the site. This was originally the farm site and land that his parents Marvin and Violet Coil had purchased 66 years ago, and farmed for 40 years. It was one of the best possible places in the world for a young boy to grow up and discover the joys of hunting, trapping and fishing. Coil said that the county ditch that now cuts through the site was a creek when he was young. Northern pike swam up it to spawn in sloughs. The land was poorly drained for farming needs. Heavy rains could flood out crops and put his father in the doldrums. His father relied on the dairy cows which grazed on the farm's grass pastures. As a consequence, the farm offered lots of habitat for wildlife, and gave the farmer's son lots of opportunities for outdoor pursuits. Coil said his father worked hard to drain the land for farming, but was also protective of it for wildlife. He eschewed the use of pesticides and commercial fertilizers as much as possible. Coil, who now lives near Fort Wayne, Ind., was joined by dozens of family members at the dedication. They came from addresses scattered from Florida to Colorado to Indiana, but remember this place as a tribute to Marvin and Violet Coil. ""We are now in the process of restoring his dream,'' said Coil of his father. A monument in memory of the farm couple was unveiled at the ceremony. The complex now available to all was made possible by help from partners including PheasantsForever, Minnesota Waterfowl Association, The Crow River Organization of Water, Blomkest Sportsmen's Club and Lake Lillian Sportsmen's Club. Matt Holland of New London, representing PheasantsForever, noted that conservationist Aldo Leopold had warned of the disconnection that can occur when people don't live on the farm or experience how it is the land that gives us what we need. ""Thanks for providing us a farm,'' said Holland to the Coil family.

167393,799 words,The New York Times,Section F; Column 1; Science Desk; Pg. 6,"Splish-Splash, Gorillas Are Taking a Bath and Sending a Message",2001,"That teenage showoff doing cannonballs off the high dive at the local pool has a counterpart in the wild: male gorillas, who have been seen jumping into and otherwise splashing about a swamp in West Africa. The rare activity, observed among western lowland gorillas in the Congo Republic, appears to be intended to intimidate rivals, said Richard J. Parnell, who reported the behavior in a brief paper in the journal Nature. ""They want to communicate and want to say something about themselves -- 'Look, I'm here,' or 'Don't mess with me,' "" said Mr. Parnell, of the WildlifeConservationSociety and the Scottish Primate Research Group at the University of Stirling in Scotland. During 32 months of watching gorillas at the 30-acre swamp, Mbeli Bai, near the Cameroon border, Mr. Parnell and a colleague at Stirling, Dr. Hannah M. Buchanan-Smith, saw only about 90 ""splash displays,"" mostly by mature males called silverbacks. The displays included one-handed and two-handed splashes and the full ""body splash,"" when the gorilla leaps off a boggy surface into a channel of water up to five feet deep. Since adult gorillas can weigh 400 pounds, a body splash is a spectacular sight. But even a one-handed splash can make a large plume of water, Mr. Parnell said. There is only one other known observation of gorillas splashing about in this way; indeed, until fairly recently gorillas were thought to avoid water. Among other nonhuman primates, only chimpanzees have been seen on rare occasions throwing rocks into water to make a display. Most of the silverbacks studied were leaders of family groups (with several adult females and other immature gorillas in their charge), and Mr. Parnell said that two-thirds of the splashes were made as socially aggressive acts toward other groups. So the behavior seems meant to ward off rival suitors rather than to attract the attention of another female. Reinforcing this is the fact that when solitary silverbacks made splash displays, they often did so toward other solitary males, when there were no females around. The social interactions of western lowland gorillas have been difficult to study in the wild because they mostly inhabit heavily forested areas with limited visibility for researchers. Because primatologists have to get close to watch, they often end up frightening the gorillas or otherwise disturbing the observations. The bai (a Pygmy word for swamp, pronounced bye), however, affords visibility of several hundred yards or more, so the researchers can see (and be seen) without being disruptive. ""This is the first place where we've been able to get a handle on what these gorillas are doing socially,"" Mr. Parnell said. The visibility, he added, may be what is making these gorillas act in this way -- unlike in the forest, they have a need to be seen over longer distances. Out of the water, gorillas make similar flapping movements with their arms as part of displays (males, in fact, spend much of their time strutting, charging, beating their chests and otherwise acting aggressively), so some of the splashing appears to be an adaptation of dry-land behavior, with the incorporation of water making for a display that's viewable over greater distances. ""Whether that tells us they're much smarter than we thought before, I'm not sure,"" Mr. Parnell said. ""But they have clearly adapted land types."" Dr. Alexander Harcourt, an expert on gorillas at the University of California at Davis, called the new observations a 'fascinating finding,"" in that it is rare to encounter gorillas in water at all, much less see them so at ease in it. But he took issue with Mr. Parnell's description of the behavior as an ""unusual social display."" ""They aren't displaying in a new way in water,"" Dr. Harcourt wrote in an e-mail message. ""Parnell and Buchanan-Smith are describing exactly what I have seen on land, with the only difference being that the gorillas happen to be doing it in water."" But Mr. Parnell noted that while the main splashing activities resemble those that take place on land, there are enough differences -- in the context, how they are done, and the distances to their targets -- that they should be considered unique behaviors. Mr. Parnell said that he was ""absolutely incredulous"" when he first saw a gorilla splashing around. ""To see them leaping bodily into the water and swinging their arms about is really quite astounding,"" he said. But occasionally the result is more comic than commanding, Mr. Parnell said. Sometimes the gorillas misjudge the water depth, and end up jumping into the swamp's equivalent of the deep end, unhappily submerging themselves for a few moments. ""Then they drag themselves out on the other side,"" Mr. Parnell said, ""looking quite like their pride has been damaged rather than reinforced.""","['want', 'commun', 'want', 'say', 'look', 'said', 'stirl', 'watch', 'stirl', 'saw', 'cal', 'includ', 'leap', 'weigh', 'is']",123,15,['cal'],1,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,"['commun', 'say', 'said']",3,4
120238,527 words,The Washington Post,Metro; B01,"Number of Smoggy Days Falls, Study Says; Region Still Needs to Cut Pollution Under U.S. Clean Air Standards",2006,"The number of dangerously smoggy days in the Washington area has declined by more than 40 percent since 2003, but the region still does not meet federal standards for healthy air, according to data released yesterday. From 2003 to 2006, the region has had 63 days in which the levels of ground-level ozone  --  a harmful gas formed when the sun heats polluted air  -- was high enough for Code Orange, Code Red or Code Purple warnings. From 1999 to 2002, there were 114 such days, according to the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. Officials said yesterday that they were encouraged, believing the reduction in bad air days was a sign that local and national anti-pollution measures were having an effect. ""The air's cleaner,"" said D.C. Council member Phil Mendelson (D-At Large), chairman of COG's air quality committee. ""But not clean enough."" That's because the Washington region, which has exceeded smog limits repeatedly since 1977, still hasn't improved enough to meet the smog standards the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will begin enforcing in 2009. At that point, a violation could trigger a loss of federal transportation funding. Moreover, local environmental groups were wary of the report, wondering whether cooler weather, not reduced smog, was partly responsible for the improvement. This might seem like an odd year to tout progress in reducing air pollution. An early August heat wave caused several Code Orange days, with residents warned against exercising or working outside. In July, the region had a Code Purple day --  the worst rating and its first in more than a year. Jeff King, an air quality planner at COG, said this summer offered some confirmation that progress was being made: Although it was far hotter than in 2005, it had the same number of unhealthy air days  --  19. That appeared to mean that less smog was around for the sun to heat. ""We did have some pollution problems, but it wasn't as severe as we'd had in the past,"" King said. The pollutants that help create bad air days come from sources as diverse as power plants, cars, gas pumps and paint fumes. In explaining the reductions in bad air, local officials cited changes almost as varied. Mendelson credited new federal rules limiting the amount of nitrogen oxide in power-plant emissions and curbing auto pollution, as well as several local policy changes. Montgomery County bought more energy from wind power. The District required power companies to derive more of their electricity from renewable sources. Fairfax County retrofitted its school buses to produce cleaner emissions. Mendelson said moves such as those could continue to reduce smog, even as the region adds millions of residents and thousands of miles of roads. ""So far, the region has continued to grow significantly, and yet we're polluting less,"" he said. Frank O'Donnell of CleanAirWatch said the apparent good news was tempered by the fact that the Washington area still regularly suffers through Code Orange days and worse. ""If we're still seeing eight or 10 dirty air days in the area, that to me is still a sign that we're not there yet,"" O'Donnell said.","['said', 'was', 'temp', 'wer', 'see', 'is', 'wer', 'said']",54,8,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,"['said', 'said']",2,2
60112,573 words,"Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)",SPORTS; Pg. 18C,DNR reorganizes with an eye toward improving wildlife habitat,2012,"Hunters should see more and better wildlife habitat around Minnesota following a reorganization of key portions of the Department of Natural Resources section of wildlife, DNR officials say. ""I'm convinced we'll put more habitat on the ground, and higher quality habitat, than ever before,'' said Dennis Simon, DNR wildlife chief. Sparked primarily by the influx of money from the Legacy Amendment, the agency has realigned its forest, wetland and prairie-farmland habitat programs and put those under a single manager, Bob Welsh, a former assistant regional wildlife manager. Welsh will work with the Lessard-Sams Outdoor Heritage Council to help secure habitat projects. ""I want Bob to be the face and voice of habitat for Minnesota,'' Simon said. Simon said Welsh will identify habitat improvement opportunities and turn them into realities that benefit hunters and others. ""I really want us to refocus our energy and talent on habitat implementation,'' he said. Previously, habitat management was dispersed among different employees in the wildlife section, Simon said. Thus habitat projects were too often put on the back burner as staff focused on the more immediate needs of setting seasons, conducting surveys, implementing legislation or preventing the spread of bovine TB and chronic wasting disease. For example, Simon said, Bill Penning, the farmland wildlife program leader, was given additional responsibilities for wild turkey, mourning dove, prairie chicken and sandhill crane hunting seasons. ""He was spending more time on season issues and less time on habitat,'' Simon said. The agency has been downsized because of budget cuts in recent years, and wildlife is down 20 positions, Simon said. ""The reality is we're going to be a smaller agency,'' he said. Meanwhile, there's been an infusion of dollars from the Legacy Amendment. Wildlife has received $8 million to $14 million annually the past couple of years in Legacy Amendment grants, and applying for and processing those grants takes time and effort. ""We were just barely keeping our nose above water,'' Simon said. The reorganized section should help greatly, he said. As wildlife habitat program manager, Welsh will oversee three teams: -A prairie habitat team led by Penning that will focus on agricultural-related issues; the state's new hunter Walk-In Area program; prairie habitat research and assessment; and partnerships that result in large blocks of habitat by coordinating state, federal and nonprofit conservation. -A wetland habitat team that will work with DucksUnlimited and others to manage projects related to wild rice, shallow lakes, seasonal wetlands, wetland-grassland complexes and providing technical advice to private landowners. A team leader will be appointed soon. -A forest wildlife habitat team led by Cynthia Osmundson that will focus on the habitat needs of deer, moose and other forest species. It will be composed of forest-wildlife habitat coordinators, a ruffed grouse coordinator, a habitat assessment specialist and others. Will hunters notice the changes? ""Yes, they will. No question,'' Simon said. ""They will notice decidedly improved habitat on our WMAs [wildlife management areas]. We're going to intensively manage shallow basins on private and public lands'' to make them more productive for waterfowl, he said. ""It will be less visible in the forest because we still do most of our habitat management through commercial timber harvest.''","['work', 'man', 'rel', 'wild', 'lak', 'wetlandgrassland', 'provid', 'be', 'appoint', 'led', 'foc', 'be', 'compos']",79,13,[],0,[],0,['appoint'],1,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,1
107471,2124 words,"Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN)",TRAVEL; LAST BEST PLACES; Pg. 1G,"LAST BEST PLACES; A TRAVELER'S GUIDE; INTO THE CANYON; The Colorado River is dammed, the air tainted, the roads jammed. Yet the Grand Canyon remains an icon of the national landscape, and its wonders only begin at the rim.",2006,"With each step, my boots kicked up little clouds of yellow dust. The desert sun shone brightly, pushing my shadow along in front of me. The click-click-click of my friends' walking sticks marked the pace. My eyes and ears wanted to stay on those details because when I looked up a great void opened before me, and it made me dizzy. From where the four of us walked, just below the rim of the Grand Canyon, it was nearly a mile down to the Colorado River, and 10 miles to the North Rim. In between, an abyss yawned, ringed by striated cliffs that seemed to vibrate with color. When walking, it was a lot easier to look at my feet. Proportion, perception and scale are all knocked out of kilter in the Grand Canyon. In 1540, Garcia Lopez de Cardenas and his party of men became the first Europeans to lay eyes on it. Standing on the rim, they estimated the river in the gorge to be about 6 feet wide, and that the rocks below were as big as men. Cardenas sent three fellow explorers down to the river, thinking they'd be back shortly. They returned at the end of the day, exhausted and bewildered, saying that the rocks were bigger than the cathedral of Seville, and that they didn't even get close to the river. Led by Grand Canyon Field Institute instructor Lisa Kearsely, our party of four intended to do what the Spaniards couldn't - walk down to the Colorado River in a day. Two nights later, we'd walk out. Kearsely, a biologist and former park ranger, would guide us through the hazards of desert hiking while teaching us about an icon of the American landscape. The Grand Canyon has changed much since the Conquistadors arrived. The famously clear air is sometimes tainted with smog from as far away as Los Angeles. The Colorado River has been dammed, drained and tamed. Nearly 4 million visitors each year add crowds, lines and parking hassles. The canyon, like most remaining wilderness areas in the Lower 48, is encroached upon from all sides. And yet, from the panoramic vistas to the jewel box-like wonders of the inner gorge, the Grand Canyon retains the power to shake one's soul. The canyon also remains a dangerous place for fragile, water-dependent creatures such as human beings. Kearsely had spent a good part of the previous day explaining how we would hike from rim to river and back again. The Grand Canyon Field Institute, an independent nonprofit organization in the park, offers learning vacations year-round. The one I chose last August was called ""Mule-Assisted Backpack""; we'd each be sending 30 pounds of camping gear down the gorge on the early-morning mule train; we'd leave later, carrying 20 to 30 pounds, including water, on our own backs. The Paiute called the plateau Kaibabits - mountain lying down. For hikers, the canyon is like an inverted mountain. First the descent, then the ascent. ""That fools a lot of people,"" Kearsely said. ""It seems so easy until you start back up. Every year people die because they underestimated it."" The combination of high altitude and desert heat can be the undoing of even a fit athlete. The climb out of the canyon is a feat similar to summit day on Mount Rainier, with an elevation gain of nearly 5,000 feet. Nine people died on the canyon's trails in 2004, and more than 250 had to be rescued, most because of heat exhaustion. Stepping back in time Other potentially fatal hazards covered by Kearsely included falling, lightning strikes, rattlesnakes, scorpions, drowning and hyponatrimia, which is when you drink too much water without replenishing minerals and salt. Heeding her advice, I carried more than a gallon of water and a supply of salted nuts. My fellow travelers were two women, a psychologist celebrating her 60th birthday and a 41-year-old audiologist, both coincidentally from New York. Kearsely, 44, lives in Flagstaff. She's a lean, plainspoken mother of two. She let us set the pace, following close behind, often stopping to offer insight. ""They say with every step you take into the canyon, you're going back 20,000 years,"" Kearsely said, pausing in the shade by a sheer wall of yellow stone. ""By the time we get to the bottom, we'll be looking at rock that's 2 billion years old."" ""Take a closer look here, you can see all kinds of sea life,"" she said. She pointed out little fossil seashells and remnants of coral that lived in this part of the continent 250 million years ago when it was covered by an inland sea. The next layer down, a few million years deeper in the past, was an even paler yellow, which Kearsely pointed out was an area of calcified sand dunes. ""It was a free-blowing area of dunes bigger than the Sahara,"" she said. Thus the morning went - inland seas, mucky swamps and evidence of long-gone creatures: a million years every 50 steps. The sun got hotter. A mule train passed us coming up the canyon, leaving us in a cloud of dust. The Kaibab Trail is 7 miles long. We went through steep switchbacks, across open plateaus and then down more switchbacks. The canyon walls rose above us, bit by bit. We passed by a field of agave plants, giant flowers on bright green, bamboolike poles 15 and 20 feet high. Kearsely said that the agave stores moisture and energy in its root ball for 20 or 30 years, and then in one explosion of passion, sends up that glorious flower to reproduce. Then it dies. Such is life in the desert. By midafternoon, ankles and knees beaten from walking downhill for seven hours, we reached the river. It was nearly as wide as the Mississippi at St. Anthony Falls, and much faster moving. We crossed narrow Black Bridge and walked into the side canyon carved by Bright Angel Creek. Tall cottonwood trees threw down welcome shade. Big battles over dams We passed a thermometer declaring it was 110 degrees, and staked a claim on one of the campsites lining the creek. Hikers who'd arrived ahead of us were already sitting on their haunches in the 2-foot-deep creek, trying to cool down. We threw down our packs, drank our fill of cold water from the shared tap and then sat down in the creek in front of our camp. It was blissful. After a nap and a rehydrated dinner (mine was turkey tetrazzini), we walked back down to the river and sat on the beach. The sun was already behind the canyon walls, and the sky was a deepening shade of blue. The Grand Canyon has been the site of two major, national environmental battles. In the 1950s, the federal government proposed a dam upstream of the Grand Canyon to collect drinking water and generate power for the growing cities of the Southwest. Conservation groups wanted to save what would be lost under water: gorgeous slot canyons, Anasazi ruins and plants and animals that hadn't even been discovered yet. Dam supporters won the day. In 1963, Glen Canyon Dam was completed. Two similar dams were proposed in the Grand Canyon. Led by the SierraClub, opponents of the dams persuaded Congress to reject the proposals. A brilliant ad campaign was considered the pivotal blow. Responding to Corps of Engineers assertions that flooding the inner gorge would allow more people to enjoy the Grand Canyon, the SierraClub took out full-page newspaper ads asking this question: ""Should we also flood the Sistine Chapel so tourists can get nearer the ceiling?"" That victory was tempered by the unanticipated effects of Glen Canyon Dam on the Grand Canyon. ""People knew what would happen upstream,"" Kearsely said. ""But they didn't pay much attention to what would happen downstream. And here we are, 90 miles downstream in a much-changed environment."" Before the dam, the Colorado was a warm, silty river that flooded massively in spring, carrying 4 to 5 tons of silt and sand downstream every second, she said. It scoured the shoreline, tearing away the previous year's vegetation and creating new sandbars and broad beaches. A river transformed The dam ended all that. River flow was regulated according to the power needs of growing cities such as Phoenix and Flagstaff, not natural cycles. Further, the dam trapped the silt that normally would make new beaches. Because the water was released from well beneath the surface of newly created Lake Powell, it was clear and typically colder than 50 degrees. Several species of fish couldn't survive in the radically altered river, and several other species are still in danger of extirpation. Beaches have steadily eroded and invasive species, such as the tamarisk tree, have taken over parts of the shoreline that are no longer scoured in annual floods. Kearsely pointed out a line of gnarled mesquite and catsclaw acacia trees, nearly 40 feet above the river. ""That's the old flood line. You'll notice there aren't any young acacias or mesquites growing; without that floodstage, they can't reseed."" Kearsely said she and her husband, also a biologist, participated in research projects on how the dam affected the downstream environment, and that the story is never simple. While tamarisk trees crowd out native species, they also provide needed nesting sites for willow flycatchers, a rare songbird. ""You have to decide what's good versus what's bad. There used to be no vegetation here, now there is,"" Kearsely said, looking around at the overgrown shoreline. ""Some people talk about decommissioning the dam, turning the Colorado back into a warm, silty river. But you can't go back. The tamarisk will still be here, and the native fish will still be gone. It will never be the way it was before."" The sky was getting dark. We heard a couple of yips, and spotted a fox about 50 feet away. He sat placidly outside his den, sniffing the evening air and getting ready for the night's prowl, completely unconcerned with us. I was exhausted, and it was still hot. My cohorts wandered down to the Phantom Ranch canteen, which becomes a beer hall each night for the backpackers and mule passengers who are staying over. I laid down on my sleeping bag in my shorts and looked up at the sky. I didn't bother putting up my tent. Down by the river, there was a bulletin board with notices and warnings for hikers. A flier said to be sure to enjoy the night sky. ""Did you know that only 10 percent of the world's population can see the Milky Way? The rest live in areas where the night sky is so polluted with artificial light that only the brightest stars are visible."" The sky above me was somewhat constrained by the walls of Bright Angel Canyon, but the Milky Way was as vivid as the cliff faces had been in daylight. I saw a couple of falling stars, and watched the stately passage of at least a dozen satellites, beaming messages that, thank God, weren't for me. I live in a city where I cannot see the Milky Way, or even satellites, so I enjoyed lying there, breathing the desert air, sweating and imagining the billions of years it had taken for that light from the stars to reach my tiny eyes. Many things are lost and gained when people impose their order on the natural world. What I felt that night, as part of the privileged 10 percent of humanity that could see the Milky Way, was that the biggest loss may be awareness of what was lost in the first place. Many people live and die without ever seeing the Milky Way, and many people live and die without setting foot in a wilderness. They can never know the beauty and power of a place that manages and orders itself. Ultimately, that's the greatest danger to the wild places that remain. Why would anyone want to save a wilderness if wilderness is just an abstract concept? For our small party in the inner gorge of the Grand Canyon, the evidence was tangible. We soaked under waterfalls, spotted bighorn sheep and mule deer, and took a long nap on a big flat rock in the shade. All of those places would have been under water had the Colorado been dammed in the canyon. We got up before sunrise the next day and, with a sense of sad nostalgia, began the hike out. The view from the rim of the Grand Canyon almost always inspires humility, a sense of how small and short a human life really is. The 10-mile climb out of the canyon in desert heat with 25 pounds on my back enforced that sense exponentially. It took nine hours to reach the trail head on the South Rim. Dust-covered and exhausted, I looked back down. No longer an abstraction, the view had meaning, earned with sweat and sore muscles. A mile below, the Colorado River carried on its steady, slow work, grinding the floor of the canyon and carrying the detritus downstream, speck by speck, as it has for millions of years.

135257,834 words,Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News,STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS,Lowe's: Sierra Lake Group files lawsuit,2010,"Mar. 31--CLEARLAKE -- SierraClub Lake Group (SCLG) has filed a lawsuit seeking to compel the City of Clearlake complete an environmental impact report (EIR) in relation to the Lowe's Project proposed for development at the Airport Property. The club claims that there are unanswered questions regarding environmental impacts related to the project that necessitate an EIR. ""We believe that the community deserves an EIR report. We believe that the site has enough issues and it is such a big project that the community deserves a complete review,"" Cheri Holden, SCLG chairperson said. ""I don't think that anything has been addressed in particular. They have done a broad sweep of the project. It needs to be site specific."" According to Clearlake City Administrator Dale Neiman, various studies have been done on the property throughout the years since 1996. Neiman said he has worked on the project for the past three years. He said appraisals have been done on the property as well as various engineering studies. Traffic studies have also been completed. ""There were also economical studies that were done that were to determine the best and highest use of the property,"" he said. According to Neiman, under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) there are three options for a project including exemption approved by administration, mitigated negative declaration document or EIR. ""We did a mitigated negative declaration,"" he said. ""If all the environmental impacts can be mitigated then you don't have to do an EIR. If the council didn't approve the mitigated negative declaration, then there would be no project. We felt that all the environmental impacts were mitigated."" Neiman said that mitigation efforts costs were $7.5 million. ""The environmental document that we did and the supporting studies we had basically amounted to a foot of paper,"" he said. ""The Kelseyville Lumber project, which is about 28 percent larger, there was an 11 page initial study done with the county and there was basically no mitigation. To me, in the county there is clearly a double standard. There is a standard that applies to Clearlake and a standard that applies to other areas."" Neiman said that one of the big issues with the SCLG pertained to urban decay and what would happen to Kelseyville Lumber and Piedmont Lumber if Lowe's is located in Clearlake. ""Look at the mitigation that was required for Kelseyville Lumber compared to Lowe's. There was basically no mitigation,"" he said. Neiman said according to a study by Keyser Marston Associates, in relation to building materials, sales exceed potential with a sales ""surplus"" or negative leakage of $8.5 million. Basically, he said this means that more revenues are being taken in than can be justified by the population. The Keyser Marston study says that an important dimension is missed in considering only the numerical estimates, namely the possibility that the lack of competitive pricing by local stores artificially inflates sales resulting in a sales ""surplus."" ""With the exception of one builder (out of five) whom we interviewed, the Lake County builders indicated that the bulk of their purchases for materials (particularly lumber) are made out-of-county due to non-competitive pricing of local stores. The perceived price differential ranged from 15 percent to more than 30 percent,"" the study states. ""Based on the housing survey we did, 26 percent of our residential dwellings are dilapidated and not fit for someone to live in. There are a lot of disabled and retired people in Clearlake who have low disposable incomes. The sad thing is they can't afford to fix up their homes because of the costs,"" he said. ""More competition in the county would benefit the lower income residents and allow them to afford to maintain their homes."" Neiman said that completion of an EIR would cost between $200,000 to $300,000 and push the project back two years, which he said could threaten the fruition of the project. ""One of the sad things is that citizens of Clearlake will continue to suffer if we're not able to better the city by providing tax revenues to better the services,"" he said. ""If we do an EIR the issues will be exactly the same and the project will be pushed out at least two years."" Neiman said that a lawsuit also presents a potential for detrimental repercussions. ""We are on the verge potentially filing bankruptcy and this could push us over the brink,"" he said.

31951,607 words,The New York Times,Section A;Â  Page 20;Â  Column 1;Â  Editorial Desk,A Modest Step to Save the Fish,1995,"It is hard to believe that at some point in the future there will not be enough fish in the sea for those countries that depend upon them for protein and for the fishermen who make their living from them. But the truth is that the world's fisheries are in poor shape. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, once an ardent booster of highly mechanized fleets that sweep up fish by the ton, now says that virtually every commercial fish species is either declining or at serious risk. It took a long time and a lot of work by environmental organizations to get that fact across to the people who write the laws of the sea. But the truth has finally sunk in. Last Friday, after two years of protracted and bitter negotiations, delegates from 100 countries meeting under the auspices of the United Nations approved the first international treaty to regulate fishing on the high seas. This is not a perfect treaty. For one thing, it provides real safeguards for only 20 percent of the ocean's fish stocks -- so-called ""straddling"" fish that migrate from coastal waters to the high seas. It does not cover the far greater volume of fishing that occurs in territorial waters within each country's 200-mile ""exclusive economic zone."" As the environmental group Greenpeace noted last week, there will still be ""too many boats chasing too few fish."" Still, this was an action of signal importance, a rare moment of clarity, good will and common sense among international bureaucrats who often find it difficult to agree on anything. For the 20 percent of the fish population covered, the treaty contains tough protection. It requires signatories to minimize the appalling waste generated by fishing fleets, which annually dump millions of tons of dead ""bycatch"" at sea. It also establishes enforcement procedures that will allow inspectors to board and search vessels. The inspectors could order the ships into port if they are found to be exceeding allowable quotas and using illegal gear -- nets or other equipment that do not fish ""selectively"" but instead sweep up all living things in their path, with colossal collateral damage to species like porpoises, sea turtles and whales. There are three tasks left. The treaty will require ratification by at least 30 nations, a figure that seems within reach despite what is almost certain to be fierce parliamentary debate in the six countries -- Japan, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan and Poland -- that send their fleets deep into international waters and account for 90 percent of the world's catch on the high seas. The second task is for individual countries to strengthen their own laws governing fishing practices within the sovereign, 200-mile limits -- the territorial waters not covered by the treaty. Although the United States Senate will almost surely approve the treaty, it could send a strong signal to other countries by also reforming the basic American law -- known as the Magnuson Act -- when it comes up for re-authorization later this year. As unemployed cod fishermen in New England and out-of-work halibut fishermen in Alaska can attest, this country does not excel in fish management. Finally, governments everywhere should rethink their old but now discredited practice of bailing out bloated and overcapitalized fishing fleets. By U.N. estimates, fishermen lose about $20 billion each year despite worldwide sales of $70 billion. The difference is made up by government subsidies. The U.N. conference has taken an important first step. But much remains to be done to end a self-defeating assault on an increasingly unsustainable resource.","['not', 'be', 'chas', 'was', 'find', 'agr', 'cov', 'contain', 'requir', 'minim', 'gen', 'fish', 'dump']",86,13,[],0,['dump'],1,[],0,[],0,[],0,['cov'],1,[],0,['not'],1,3

An example is the Environmental Protection Agency's rejection of a state mitigation plan regarding the ""regional haze"" that the EPA claims is adversely affecting federal wildlife refuges. Rather than accepting a plan endorsed by utilities and state environmental officials, the EPA has ordered a harsh and expensive remedy for haze linked to coal-fired power plants. Rather than bail out of the fight and accept EPA's diktat, Pruitt has sued the agency. Gov. Mary Fallin, a fellow Republican who has a similar anti-federal bureaucracy worldview, praised Pruitt's decision to commit state resources to this battle. If Pruitt's challenge fails, not only will taxpayers be out the cost of the challenge but electricity consumers - all of us - will be forced to cover the enormous costs ($1 billion plus for OG&E customers alone) of outfitting older coal-fired plants with pollution scrubbers. The state's plan stressed a gradual conversion of electrical generation to natural gas-fired plants, a cleaner alternative that has the advantage of using gas extracted within the state. The EPA's intransigence means Wyoming coal will continue to make power here. The anti-business SierraClub and the EPA care little about the cost to consumers. For them, a billion here and a billion there are worth it to force their narrow agenda on the rest of us.

146038,786 words,Bangor Daily News (Maine),Pg. A1,Revised Plum Creek plan still massive,2006,"Ending months of anticipation and speculation, Plum Creek Timber Co. released details Tuesday of a scaled-down but still massive development proposal for nearly 1,000 houses, additional recreational trails and a world-class Nordic resort near Moosehead Lake. Plum Creek officials said the revisions to their Moosehead Lake plan reflect the recurring themes expressed by residents and organizations during the past year to permanently protect more forests while still jump-starting a sluggish local economy through strategic, well-placed development. Representatives of some environmental groups remained critical of the proposal, which at more than 420,000 acres is the largest development in Maine history. The company's new 30-year development plan, which is subject to state regulatory approval, calls for: .  480 shorefront lots on Moosehead and nearby lakes, ponds and streams plus 495 ""backwoods"" lots. The original proposal had 575 shorefront lots. .  A resort on Big Moose Mountain offering Nordic skiing, bicycling, golf and snowmobiling. .  A significantly scaled-back resort on the Lily Bay peninsula. .  Conservation easements on more than 400,000 acres in the region guaranteeing public access for hunting, hiking, fishing and other traditional activities. .  Permanent public access to 144 miles of hiking and snowmobile trails. Tuesday's media event was the second Plum Creek has held in advance of submitting its revised plans to the Land Use Regulation Commission sometime next week. The company unveiled plans last week to partner with The NatureConservancy, the Appalachian Mountain Club and the Forest Society of Maine on the conservation easements. Plum Creek on Tuesday also made some significant deletions to its original proposal, eliminating plans for campgrounds and for rental cabins in remote areas, and more than halving the number of lakes and ponds where development will happen. ""It strikes a balance,"" said Luke Muzzy, Plum Creek's senior land asset manager. ""It's conservation, economic development, and, of course, it works for us."" Plum Creek enlisted the help of economic development officers, a Greenville-area business owner and the Sportsman's Alliance of Maine to talk up the revised plan during a press conference in the state Capitol. ""Wow. As a lifelong resident of Greenville, that was my reaction to this plan,"" said Craig Watt, a Greenville business owner and member of the group Friends of Moosehead. Watt called Plum Creek's plan ""amazing"" and said it would help preserve traditions and the region's high quality of life. Others in the crowd were less enthusiastic. ""My first impression is they really didn't listen to Maine people,"" said Cathy Johnson of the Natural Resources Council of Maine. Johnson said that, contrary to Plum Creek officials' statements, residents were concerned with both the number of house lots and their location. In a report released last month, NRCM called on Plum Creek to reduce by up to two-thirds the number of house lots and to cluster them all around existing communities. Diane Guethlen, who moved to a house on Moosehead Lake with her husband 15 years ago, said she fears that the scope of the development as well as its location may hurt the unique character of the region. She also questioned whether buyers of second homes will spend much money at local businesses. ""There is already enough development on the lake,"" Guethlen said. ""What makes it special and makes people want to come there is that it is remote and has that wild feeling."" But Mark Scarano, executive director of the Piscataquis County Economic Development Council, said he believes the resorts, the growth in nature-based tourism as well as a sawmill still included in the plan will help reverse disturbing trends in the local economy. ""What does continued low wages and what does a loss of population do to the character of the region?"" Scarano asked. Jim Lehner, the general manager of Plum Creek's Northeast region, said the 975 house lots would be developed over 10 years to alleviate concerns of a sudden build-out in the region. Lehner said the proposed resort at Lily Bay had been reduced in scope dramatically and would not begin to take shape for at least seven years after the plan receives regulatory approval. If accepted by LURC, which oversees development in the Unorganized Territory, Plum Creek's rezoning request will set in motion one of the largest and most anticipated regulatory review processes in Maine history. Scoping sessions held by LURC last summer drew more than 1,000 people, and some people are predicting that even larger crowds will show up for LURC public hearings and meetings on the matter.

56180,2461 words,Chicago Daily Herald,NEWS; Pg. 1,The swan song for some Illinois birds?,2004,"Recreational birder Bob Montgomery stood at the edge of dying grassland in Hampshire that just weeks before had been one of his favorite places to visit. For years, Montgomery had pulled his car over to the side of this rural road in Kane County to watch prairie birds. Sandwiched between a subdivision across the street and a soybean field on the other side of the road, the grassy patch was a haven for prairie birds. Crouching so as not to be seen or heard, Montgomery had watched the bobolink, one of the more conspicuous birds that sings in midair. Now the patch was simply brown shards of dead grass that had been chemically treated to make way for stout-leaved soybean plants, which are far too short for the bobolink, a songbird that evolved in the tall grass prairie, which once dominated Illinois. Described by famed naturalist Henry Thoreau as a ""flashing, tinkling meteor,"" the bobolink has disappeared from Illinois by about 9 percent annually since 1966. Across the country, it has been declining about 1 percent annually about 11 million survive, about half its earlier count. With a sad heart, Montgomery turned away and drove off. Yet he could hardly be surprised. It was simply the latest in a long string of experiences he'd had. ""I've been around long enough that I don't get upset about it,"" Montgomery said. ""If it was up to me, I'd set aside more land (for prairie birds), but it's not up to me."" Falling away Although many Illinois birds are thriving, several appear to be in trouble, according to the 2004 Audubon State of the Birds report issued this fall. More than a quarter of 415 U.S. bird species with reliable population trend information were found to be losing numbers significantly in the past 35 years, said Greg Butcher, director of bird conservation at the NationalAudubonSociety in Washington, D.C. As an indicator of the overall health of the natural environment, birds usually reveal a larger problem within the natural world long before it becomes readily apparent like a build up of toxins, also harmful to humans, in the soil or air. Birds are prime insect eaters, and their declines could lead to more money being spent on pesticides to combat infestations. A famine, drought or a rash of diseases could send declining birds quickly to the edge of extinction, costing taxpayers money in a last-ditch attempt to rescue these species. The six-county region of Will, Lake, DuPage, Cook, McHenry and Kane counties has been a focal point for many of the 300 bird species that occur regularly within Illinois. Compared to most other areas of the state, northeastern Illinois has more diversity of wetlands, woodlands and prairies because early 20th-century leaders created conservation districts. As a result, the six-county region has a higher concentration of rare species compared with most other parts of the state. Degraded natural land and continued development in the six counties could threaten to push out some of the more sensitive birds. Citing the North American Breeding Bird Survey, a national bird tally, Audubon found 76 of 164 woodland species were losing numbers. Also, 39 out of 106 water and wetlands species surveyed were falling away. Yet the title of the fastest declining group belongs to prairie birds, an assemblage that has long laid claim to Illinois - the Prairie State. Audubon reported that 23 of 27 surveyed prairie bird species, or 85 percent, were declining. More than 115 years ago, ornithologist Robert Ridgeway in 1889 in the ""Ornithology of Illinois"" was probably one of the first to note the prairie birds' demise when he wrote: ""The transformation was complete. ...As a consequence, we searched in vain for the characteristic prairie bird. ...We left our beautiful prairie with a sad heart, disgusted with the change which civilization had wrought."" Fall of the prairie On a rainy, fall day, Alan Anderson of Des Plaines strolls along a gravel path lined with tall grass at the Chicago Botanic Garden, a 385-acre preserve of woods, grasslands and wetlands in North suburban Glencoe. When he's not working as a hospital lab technician, Anderson spends his time birding, ""an addictive hobby."" His passion for birds extends past recreational bird watching. He serves as vice president of the Chicago Audubon Society. He's also a member of the Bird Conservation Network, the Chicago Ornithological Society and the Illinois Ornithological Society. As a top bird caller, he has been the primary bird monitor in the Cook County Nesting Season Bird Census as well as a major contributor to the 2004 Illinois Breeding Bird Atlas. ""They like thistle,"" Anderson says while watching goldfinches flit among the prairie grass. ""They don't care as long as it's thistle."" He explains the garden's 15-acre Susan Dixon Prairie is too small for the bobolink, a gregarious black bird known as the harlequin of the meadows, which prefers 50 to 100 acres in order to hide hatchlings nesting on the ground from predators in a landscape devoid of trees. ""Once in a great while, I'll see a bobolink,"" he says. The bobolink's documented downward trend since the 1960s is shared by other well-known Illinois grassland birds. Across the country, the eastern meadowlark has declined by about 66 percent to about 10 million. The short-eared owl has plummeted by 69 percent to 2.4 million birds nationwide. The Henslow's sparrow had dropped 96 percent from 1966 to 2003. Now fewer than 80,000 survive. However, these birds found a resurgence in the 1990s with a federal program called the Conservation Reserve Program, which requires farmers to set aside large land tracts for nonproduction to control oversupply and for conservation purposes. Between 1990 and 2003, the Henslow's sparrow numbers in Illinois have stabilized and are now increasing their number at approximately 0.5 percent per year. The Illinois Endangered Species Protection Board recently proposed that the Henslow's sparrow should be upgraded from an endangered species to a threatened species because its numbers are increasing. However, in its decision, the board said the birds were still vulnerable because governmental programs can be short-term endeavors that last about 10 to 15 years. ""(Federal) programs come and go,"" said Stephen Packard, director of the Audubon - Chicago Region about the future of the Henslow's sparrow. ""It's not certain what will happen to them."" As more farms and open grassland are developed, prairie birds in 100 years will be relegated to preserves, said Jim Herkert, a grassland bird expert at the Illinois NatureConservancy. The 19,000-acre Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie, about 40 miles south of Chicago, opened 5,000 acres to the public this summer. A former Army base now under restoration, Midewin is large enough to sustain stable prairie bird populations, he said. ""These birds are remarkably resilient,"" Herkert said. ""We took out their habitat and they are still here. Given half a chance, they can persist. The question is, will they be given half a chance?"" Farms and feathers One of the last farmers in the Northwest suburbs, 80-year-old Allen F. Busse, who lives near Elk Grove Village, explains the prairie birds' fall through the evolution of farming. By the time Friedrich and Johanna Busse arrived in the region in 1848, most of the tall grass that once dominated Illinois had vanished, Busse said. New England Yankees had bought and cleared the land before selling it to German immigrants like his family, said Busse. Before European settlement, 23 million of the state's 36 million acres had been prairies. Now about 2,300 acres of high-quality prairie remain, which is about .01 percent of the original acres that once grew across the upper two-thirds of the state, according to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. The Busses' forefathers used horses to help till the land, Busse said. A quarter of the farm was devoted to hay for feed. In these hay fields, the birds survived after the prairie had been converted to farms. In the late 1800s, the train allowed farmers to transport large amounts of product faster than ever before, so there was an incentive to plant more land. The automobile plow, later called the tractor, began transforming agriculture in the early 1900s. The horse eventually exited along with the hayfields. Still, there was no quick way to move the produce to the local market before it spoiled, so there was no need to plant all the land. Therefore, farmers planted part of the land with grasses to prevent soil erosion, and the birds survived there for a time. But then as trucks became prevalent, large quantities of fresh vegetables were moved to market far quicker than ever before, Busse said. Coupled with a growing population, it created an incentive in the 1950s and 1960s to plant wall-to-wall crops, leaving little room for the prairie birds. As Busse prepares to sell off his land to developers, he reflects on the demise of the tall grass prairie as simply a part of life. ""Like so many things,"" Busse said, ""what used to be is hard to find."" Just stopping by ""Hear the high pitch?"" Anderson asks as he continues looking for birds at the Chicago Botanic Garden. ""Golden-crowned kinglet - really high pitch."" Hundreds of birds pick off insects that are attracted to the garden's plants. Others eat berries on trees while using the garden as a stopover on a trek to wintering grounds. Some don't consume any food during the entire trip, preferring to simply rest in the trees along the way. ""The wind is out of the southwest,"" Anderson notes. ""A northwest wind would help them migrate."" The Shaw Woods Avian Monitoring Project, the Chicago area's only migratory bird banding station, has been collecting population trends and will provide some clues about why and how some birds migrate, said Lake Forest College assistant professor Caleb Gordon, head of the project. Halfway through a four-year study, Gordon and volunteers have used mist nets to catch more than 2,500 birds representing 71 species. Each one is individually numbered and banded. Millions of migrating birds fly close to Lake Michigan's coast, making the Chicago area a hotbed for migrants. These birds pick the Chicago region to fly over for the same reason that major highways and railways snake around Lake Michigan, Gordon said. Just like people, the birds are avoiding the passage over the Great Lakes. Instead, the birds hug the shore line so as not to find themselves over open water without anywhere to perch, he said. It's not clear exactly why some migrants are declining while others show stable populations and others are increasing, he said. While conditions in the breeding and wintering grounds are factors, the pathway is another consideration, Gordon said. The health of the stopover woodlands means the difference between life and death for birds that rely upon the pathway for food, said Doug Stotz, ornithologist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. The demise of native oak woodlands might be linked to some of the problems facing migrant birds. Some birds depend on oak buds to attract insects, which are most drawn when the buds first appear. For some birds, the timing of the oak buds in the spring was a key for migration. These birds evolved to time their flight with the oak instead of other trees, which bud at different times, Stotz said. According to a survey by Chicago Wilderness, an organization of environmental groups, more than half of the region's oak woodlands in the region were found to be in poor quality, meaning foreign species like European buckthorn or native species like maple were pushing it out. More than 30 percent were in fair condition, while the remainder were characterized in good or excellent shape. From 1962 to 1985, maples have increased by more than 40 times while oaks decreased by about 14 percent, according to the state's Critical Trends in Illinois Ecosystems, an environmental report card issued the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. Once fire swept through Illinois, destroying other trees, but the oak survived. It has evolved a tough bark more resilient to flames than other trees. Without fire, the oak loses its edge. It can't compete against other trees that shade its seedlings, which need direct sunlight to grow. Wetland bird woes ""It's a patient feeder,"" Anderson says of the white-feathered heron, which appears motionless, standing along the shore as Anderson continues birding. The long-necked, long-legged wader fades against the backdrop of a weeping willow, looking almost invisible about 500 feet away, but Anderson sees it even without using binoculars. A fish jumps in front of the wetland bird with the elegant ""S"" curved neck, but it still doesn't move. ""Very patient,"" Anderson says. About half of the birds on the state endangered species list are wetland birds. Less than 1 million of the original 10 million wetland acres remain in Illinois, about a 90 percent loss. The state ranks sixth in the country in overall percentage of wetland loss after California, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri and Ohio, according to the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. The six-county region, the state's most populated area, has some of the most diverse wetlands in the state. In Lake County, more than 10 percent of the land is wetland. Retired microbiologist Searle Wadley of Antioch owns one of the highest-quality wetlands in Illinois. With almost 50 black terns, the 40-acre Wadley wetland was home this year to the largest population in Illinois of these endangered birds, said Mike Ward, avian ecologist from the Illinois Natural History Survey. Rather picky about its habitat, the black tern requires large tracts of wetlands with floating mats of vegetation. Last year, the Wadley wetland experienced a drought. While the black tern returned, the state-endangered yellow-headed blackbird did not. Yet three years ago, the wetland was home to one of the state's largest yellow-headed congregations. The Wadley wetland illustrates how wetlands operate, Ward said. Unlike some other terrestrial types, wetlands cycle rapidly through good and bad years, Ward said. As a result, preservation and maintenance are paramount for wetlands because in any given year, some wetlands will not be suitable for rare birds, he said. As Anderson continues to look for birds at the Chicago Botanic Garden, he notes some birds thrive among people because of their adaptability to human behavior. ""Herring gulls - they eat anything including garbage."" Anderson says. The robin is another bird that has found its place among people. Many back yards happen to provide the perfect habitat for the robin, which finds earthworms in the soil and berries in the bushes. ""Birds that adapt (to humans) survive and expand,"" Anderson said. ""Those that don't are on the endangered species list.""","['wer', 'found', 'be', 'los', 'said', 'rev', 'becom', 'harm', 'ar', 'lead', 'being', 'spent', 'comb', 'send', 'declin', 'cost', 'rescu', 'lak', 'has', 'been', 'occ', 'ar', 'develop', 'be', 'releg', 'said', 'natureconserv', 'op', 'is', 'sustain', 'said', 'ar', 'said']",234,33,['rev'],1,"['comb', 'rescu']",2,['rev'],1,['sustain'],1,['rev'],1,['rev'],1,"['rev', 'rescu']",2,"['said', 'comb', 'said', 'said', 'said']",5,14

25412,762 words,Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News,STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS,"West Toledo rail loop vanishing into history: Proposed pedestrain, bike trail could take years to develop",2010,"May 24--Nearly 10 years after the last train used it, the railroad track that runs along Douglas Road near the University of Toledo and then cuts across several West Toledo neighborhoods is being torn up -- a victim of consolidations in the railroad industry that have left certain tracks with no purpose. But it could still be years before local transportation planners' goal of converting the former Toledo Terminal ""Back Side"" line into a pedestrian and bicycle trail is realized. The TrustforPublicLands is negotiating to buy the right of way from CSX Transportation Corp., which in February received permission from the federal Surface Transportation Board to remove 4.15 miles of track between a point along Laskey Road near Jackman Road known as Temperance Station and a junction called Vulcan near Dorr Street and Westwood Avenue. ""We're trying to get the negotiations completed this year,"" said Warren Henry, transportation director for the Toledo Metropolitan Area Council of Governments, which has worked with the trust on the trail conversion. After that, Mr. Henry said, it likely will take several years to get federal money to build the trail, which would connect at its south end with the University/Parks Trail, built during the 1990s along another former railbed. At one time, the track along Douglas was part of a complete loop around metropolitan Toledo that the other railroads used to connect with each other for exchanging freight shipments. But as mergers cut the number of railroads serving the city to just five from more than a dozen, that purpose diminished, and portions of the line that had no rail shippers fell into disuse. The last trains to run between Temperance Station and Vulcan belonged to Norfolk Southern, which formerly used the track as part of a route between its Homestead Yard in Oregon and industrial branches in Maumee and Waterville. But in 2000, Norfolk Southern rebuilt track in East Toledo that allowed it to run trains via a shorter route that became available when it took over most of Conrail's Toledo tracks the year before. The ""Back Side"" was idled in July, 2000. Although short bits of rail were removed immediately to officially take it out of service, and its Jackman Road crossing was pulled out shortly thereafter, CSX did not file for abandonment until January. Large-scale track removal began shortly after the federal order granting permission took effect in March. ""It's about time,"" said Jan Schweer, whose Bellevue Road home backs up against the former rail line. ""I used to like to hear them [the trains] at night, but if you were out back when they blew that whistle, it would just about deafen you."" Ms. Schweer said she had occasionally cut the grass along the track to keep the area looking neat, but debris made that difficult. Since then, crews have passed through again to bundle up the old railroad ties for reuse, and CSX's abandonment application said the top layer of ballast stone might be reclaimed as well. Bob Sullivan, a CSX spokesman, pledged that the right of way would be cleaned up as part of the salvage operation and confirmed that the railroad is in negotiations with the TrustforPublicLands about selling the right of way. Although Ms. Schweer expressed doubts about a public trail behind her house, Sherbrooke Road resident Bob Grogan said a ""walk path"" would be fine with him, because otherwise the old railbed probably would become a dumping ground. ""I'd think it'd be all right,"" he said. ""They can't do anything else with the land. It'd be an easy project, not a real costly project."" Mr. Grogan thought a ""very preliminary"" cost estimate of $15 million that Mr. Henry provided seemed excessive. The route includes two substantial bridges: one over the Ottawa River and Bancroft Street that the railroad will leave behind, the other over I-475 that an Ohio Department of Transportation contractor will remove during a freeway widening project scheduled to start this year. State transportation department officials said there is a plan to replace the latter with a lighter-duty bridge suitable for a pedestrian-bicycle trail.

68811,200 words,Pittsburgh Tribune Review,NA,Flu factories,2006,"Before the discovery of the deadly Asian H5N1 strain of avian influenza, the worst bird flu outbreak in the world was not in China, but in Pennsylvania during 1983-84. The H5N2 outbreak in the Keystone State led to the deaths of 17 million birds at a cost to taxpayers and consumers of $400 million. While it's important for cities to try to mediate the impact of the next flu pandemic (""Municipalities now winging it on bird flu,"" July 30 and PghTrib.com), it's critical to try to prevent outbreaks of bird flu in the first place. The United Nations has called on all governments to fight what they call ""factory farming"" to prevent the spread and mutation of these viruses into more dangerous forms. On any given day, Pennsylvania poultry producers overcrowd more than 20 million chickens into filthy, football field-sized sheds to live beak-to-beak in their own manure, a veritable breeding ground for disease. The poultry industry needs to move away from this industrial model for the health and welfare of both birds and people. Michael Greger Washington, D.C.

103471,715 words,San Bernardino Sun (California),NEWS,Keeping an eye out for sick puppies at border,2007,"Illegal activity at the U.S.-Mexico border extends beyond humans and drugs. Humane officer Jamie Simmons has been there, looked into the frightened eyes of sick and fragile puppies. Jamie, with the HumaneSociety of San Bernardino Valley, has just returned from a two-week operation at the Otay Mesa and San Ysidro ports of entry. Her mission? To help investigate the trafficking of thousands of underage and sick puppies across the border. Jamie has been part of the Border Puppy Task Force, a consortium of 18 California animal-welfare and law-enforcement agencies that worked together for the well-being and protection of animals brought from Mexico to the United States through California border entry points. ""Many of the puppies are discovered to be sick, potentially creating a health epidemic for animals and people here,"" Jamie said. ""Adding to this problem are the inhumane breeding and transportation issues, the animal overpopulation problem we already have, and the fact that people spend thousands of dollars on veterinary bills for a puppy in poor health - which often dies."" Puppies, many of them popular toy breeds, are being brought into California for resale, where the markup can be as much as 1,000 percent. ""We were surrounded by customs and border agents at all times,"" Jamie said. ""Because drugs may also be coming across, there was an element of danger to see those Border Patrol agents and what they are exposed to every day - both with drug and people smuggling."" Jamie, a former Riverside County animal control officer, said she is honored to have been part of the task force for three years. Often, these animals are not being taken care of properly. and the sellers, brokers and transporters may face animal-cruelty charges, according to Jamie, who inspected at least 200 dogs. There were puppies that were severely dehydrated, a puppy with traumatic damage to its nervous system, and a Chihuahua only about 2 weeks old. ""It is unlawful to smuggle animals into the United States,"" Jamie pointed out. ""It's a federal crime."" Several of the dogs were confiscated or surrendered to San Diego County Animal Control. ""Many of the people I dealt with were headed to the Inland Empire,"" Jamie said. Colton resident Ofelia Carrillo and her husband, Javier, who purchased a toy French poodle Sept. 18 at the border, said they would never do it again. ""I don't recommend buying one of these dogs,"" Ofelia said. ""There's a 98 percent chance you'll be going on an emotional roller coaster. You won't be getting what you think you're getting - either age or health-wise."" The Carillos' puppy, Pearl, was not 9 weeks old as they had been told, but 7 weeks old. The 1.5-pound puppy had also been exposed to parvo. Pearl is recovering - but only after her owners spent hundreds of dollars on veterinarian fees. ""You think by going down there you'll save some money on a dog but you end up losing time, money and sleep,"" Ofelia said. ""People should also beware when purchasing puppies at swap meets, in parking lots, and answering ads online or in throw-away newspapers. These animals can cost from $300 to $1,000 and may be underage, very sick and carrying diseases that are not initially visible."" Taking puppies away from their mothers before they're old enough violates California law, Jamie said, adding. ""You cannot sell underage animals."" Diseases pose threats for both animals and their owners. Parvo in young puppies is a disease with an outcome that is never good,"" said Jamie, whose specialty is animal-cruelty cases. ""When purchasing a pet,"" she said, ""there are some things you should look for - proof of vaccination, and does the animal appear healthy? Is the animal lethargic? Are there signs of parasites?"" As the staff humane officer, Jamie is focusing on training and being at a centralized location for officers to gain training in their field, she said. She will conduct her first training workshop, ""Illegal Animal Fighting Class,"" Oct. 9. The class is designed for law-enforcement, code-enforcement and animal-control agencies. ""There are a lot of good pet owners here in San Bernardino who just need education on animal welfare laws and improving the quality of their pet's life,"" she said. For more information, call the HumaneSociety of San Bernardino Valley at (909) 386-1400.","['has', 'return', 'help', 'investig', 'has', 'been', 'work', 'brought']",96,8,[],0,[],0,[],0,['investig'],1,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,1

101347,894 words,USA TODAY,NEWS; Pg. 3A,Cardinal Bernardin halts cancer treatment,1996,"Cardinal Joseph Bernardin said Thursday that he stopped receiving chemotherapy a week ago after a scan showed that it had not retarded the growth of his terminal pancreatic cancer. Bernardin, 68, the nation's senior active Roman Catholic official and leader of Chicago's 2.3 million Catholics, said his doctors now say he cannot expect to live more than seven months. He said his ""immediate plan is to live day by day."" He began the treatments in August after doctors said that the pancreatic cancer diagnosed a year ago had spread to his liver. He said side effects of treatments, including fatigue and digestive problems, are severe. ""It just did not seem to be worthwhile to continue"" chemotherapy, he said. FETUS DEATH CONVICTION: A Corpus Christi, Texas, jury found Frank Flores Cuellar, 50, guilty of manslaughter in a June 15 drunken-driving crash that forced the premature birth of Krystal Zuniga, who later died. The defense argued that Cuellar should not have been charged because Texas law defines a person as an individual ""who has been born and is alive."" Abortion foes hailed the verdict as a step toward tougher laws against criminal acts that harm the unborn. Abortion rights supporters warned it could lead to an overturning of abortion rights. Cuellar plans to appeal.  AIRPORT POLLUTION: Environmentalists called for replacing the 10% domestic airline ticket tax with an aviation fuel tax and other measures to curb air, water and noise pollution from airports. Some airports top smokestack industries as polluters but have largely escaped environmental regulation, the NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncil said. The fuel tax would encourage airlines to replace aging, inefficient aircraft, the group said. Air Transport Association spokesman David Fuscus said a $ 10 billion modernization program now under way will have environmental benefits. BUMPER CROP: A sharp rise in marijuana seizures along the U.S.-Mexican border indicates that Latin American growers are harvesting a big crop, federal officials said. Since Columbus Day, traditionally a high point of the marijuana smuggling year, seizures of marijuana, cocaine and heroin by the Border Patrol and Customs Service in Texas and New Mexico are up 50% over 1995, officials said. SCIENTOLOGY DISPUTE: The State Department blasted the Church of Scientology over an ""outrageous charge"" in a New York Times ad in which the church said the German government pursued Nazi-type practices. The church's full-page ad highlighted long-running disputes with Germany's government and accused it of religious intolerance. NAZI GOLD: The United States and Britain are studying a plan to give 6 tons of gold confiscated from the Nazis to Holocaust survivors, the World Jewish Congress said. British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind has written to the group saying he and White House officials would reach a decision as soon as a legal study is completed, the congress said. The gold is worth $ 75 million. Jewish groups say Swiss banks have held $ 7 billion in assets and interest since World War II. Also Thursday, Switzerland denied U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato's claim that it struck secret deals to use some of the disputed funds to compensate Swiss citizens for property nationalized by communist regimes. HURRICANE LILI: South Florida was drenched by rain and braced for possible hurricane winds as Hurricane Lili, blamed for eight drownings in Central America, bore down on Cuba with 118-mph winds. The Cuba government said it was ready to evacuate 86,000 people from the Havana area, and a hurricane warning covered two-thirds of the island. In southern Florida, showers fell on ground drenched even before Tropical Storm Josephine hit last week. As much as 8 inches of rain fell in two days in the Keys. -- TOBACCO SUIT: New York City joined the battle against the tobacco industry and sued to recoup health care costs of smokers. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., one of the companies named in the suit, called the suit baseless and politically inspired. About 15 states have filed similar suits. -- IRS BOMB ATTEMPT: Joseph Martin Bailie, 41, convicted of a failed Dec. 17 attempt to blow up the IRS building in Reno, was sentenced to 36 years in prison. -- MISSED LOTTERY: Clarence Jackson Jr., 23, showed up at Connecticut's lottery headquarters with a $ 5.8 million lottery ticket. But he will not get the prize. He missed the deadline for claiming the jackpot by three days. A new home for Campus Crusade The nation's largest evangelical organization will dedicate its new, $ 48 million home Saturday in Orlando, Fla. The 285-acre property will be headquarters to the Campus Crusade for Christ's World Center for Discipleship and Evangelism. Ground will be broken soon and the center could open by early 1998, officials said. The Saturday celebration doubles as an anniversary and birthday party. Campus Crusade observes its 45th year as a ministry; its founder, Bill Bright, turns 75. Before a religious epiphany in 1944, Bright says, ""I was a very happy pagan. . . .

85077,628 words,Tulsa World (Oklahoma),Sports; Pg. B2,Hawkins cared about future,2008,"One of the great pleasures of being an outdoors writer is the chance to meet local people who dedicate their lives to outdoors pursuits and conservation; people who have a broad view of the outdoors and our environment, the people of this country and the future. Early upon my arrival in Tulsa, folks told me I had to talk with Ken Greenwood and with Willis ""Tiny"" Tomsen. I've spent a little time with each, and when I did they both expressed regret that I could not have met Robert J. ""Bob"" Hawkins. Greenwood and Tomsen are among founders of local DucksUnlimited chapters, and are among the founders of NatureWorks Inc., a group known to most Tulsans as the outfit that holds an annual art show and has erected numerous bronze wildlife statues, most visible along Riverside Drive, and including that magnificent bison along Interstate 44 on the west edge of town. Conservation leaders that they are, both men said what they have done pales in comparison to Hawkins, who arrived in Tulsa in 1964 to take a spot at general sales manager for Braniff Airlines and in that same year became one of the leaders in the resurrection of the Tulsa DucksUnlimited annual dinner. The Broken Arrow chapter of DU was actually renamed the Bob Hawkins Chapter in his honor. He served the organization on the state level and later was on the national DU board, Greenwood said. Neither Greenwood nor Tomsen was surprised that more than 200 friends of Hawkins were present Nov. 13 for dedication of the Cottonwood Creek Wetland Unit in honor of Hawkins. The wetland, originally completed in 1991, is a target of an ambitious restoration project with the help of the new funding. The Harold C. Stuart Family Foundation and NatureWorks planted seed money for the project with $25,000, Greenwood said. DucksUnlimited then matched that amount. The Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation matched those groups, and the North American Waterfowl Plan matched that total, he said. Located on Keystone Wildlife Management Area at the confluence of Cottonwood Creek and the Cimarron River, the wetland development area totals 275 acres. The first phase of the project involves restoration of water control structures around the unit. Later plans call for construction of a permanent pumping station with a 21-inch pipe near the Cimarron River. These steps should allow managers better control of water in the unit, which is flooded or dry seasonally to provide optimum growth of forage and invertebrates while providing water for resting waterfowl. In the end it means better habitats for waterfowl and other migratory species that rely on wetlands. And it should mean prime future waterfowl hunting opportunities as well. And the future is what it's all about. Hawkins was represented at the dedication by his widow, Jacque Hawkins-Noble, as well as his son, daughter, granddaughter and sister. Hawkins-Noble said her husband's focus in his later years was the Greenwing program for youth. ""He believed that passing the love of conservation and waterfowling to the next generation was his duty,"" she said. Likewise, Greenwood said conservation is a matter of planting seeds for the future. ""Our group put in the seed money,"" he said of the NatureWorks contribution. ""Planting seeds is a good way to remember Bob. He planted a lot of good seeds for DucksUnlimited, for waterfowl and the cause of conservation."" Speaking of longtime dedication: At Monday's meeting of the Oklahoma Conservation Commission, Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation Director Greg Duffy announced his retirement. He has been with the department for more than three decades, serving 15 years as the top. He will step down in July. Richard Hatcher, assistant director, was named as designee to replace Duffy.","['ar', 'ar', 'int', 'known', 'hold', 'has', 'erect', 'includ', 'ar', 'said', 'hav', 'don', 'ar', 'tak', 'becam', 'ducksunlimit', 'was', 'renam', 'hawkin', 'serv', 'was', 'said', 'was', 'wer', 'ducksunlimit', 'match', 'match', 'match', 'said', 'loc', 'involv', 'structures', 'plant', 'ducksunlimit', 'greg', 'annount', 'has', 'been', 'serv', 'step']",300,40,[],0,['erect'],1,['don'],1,[],0,[],0,['annount'],1,[],0,"['said', 'said', 'said', 'annount']",4,7
43689,493 words,Brattleboro Reformer (Vermont),NEWS,Entergy ordered to pay attorney fees,2010,"Friday December 3, 2010 BRATTLEBORO -- The Vermont Public Service Board ruled that Entergy Nuclear will have to reimburse certain costs accrued by interested parties during a hearing regarding underground piping at the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant in Vernon. On Nov. 30, the board stated that Entergy, which owns and operates the power plant, must reimburse the New England Coalition for, ""attorney's fees and costs reasonable incurred in this Docket as a direct result of Entergy VY's provision of incorrect information regarding underground piping,"" according to the ruling from the PSB. However, wrote the PSB, ""All costs incurred prior to 2010 are denied, as they were incurred prior to the disclosure of Entergy VY's misinformation."" More than $21,000 was awarded as reimbursement to the New England Coalition, including $6,644 for its attorney Jared Margolis, $1,102 for staff member Clay Turnbull and $13,530.37 for technical consultant Raymond Shadis. Shadis said this is second time Entergy has had to reimburse the NEC. In 2004 the NEC and Entergy had a discovery dispute over a 20 percent uprate at the plant, which resulted in reimbursement of about $50,000 for a team of experts, a record sanction at the time, he said. ""The board found that Entergy's witnesses gave misleading and untrue testimony (in May 2009),"" Shadis said. ""They tried to use the 'I forgot my homework excuse' with regard to underground piping and it wasn't going to work. They weren't going to pull the wool over our eyes."" He added that the ruling is important because it highlights the fact that Entergy officials failed to tell the truth. The false information that Entergy provided to the PSB required significant additional work to get to the truth, said Sandy Levine, senior attorney for ConservationLawFoundation, which opposes the relicensing of the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant. ""This simply reimburses them for that effort,"" she said. ""They would not have done this except for the fact that Entergy was providing false information."" On July 8, ConservationLawFoundation also filed for reimbursement but a ruling has yet to be made. CLF stated that the board should award fees and costs for all future work that is, ""reasonably incurred as a direct result of Entergy VY's provision of incorrect information regarding underground piping."" Entergy had previously reached agreement on paying attorney's fees and costs with the VermontPublicInterestResearchGroup and the Windham Regional Commission. Entergy will have 10 business days to challenge any NEC reimbursement request, the ruling states. ""If Entergy VY believes that discovery is necessary to determine the reasonableness or appropriateness of NEC's request, Entergy VY may request permission to conduct such discovery, but Entergy VY's request must specifically explain why the proposed discovery is needed,"" the ruling states.

We'll be renting a car and think we would like to visit the Grand Canyon. Can you recommend something else that we could add to our itinerary without spending a lot of time driving? We like being outdoors; he loves hiking and I love walking, but not scaling great heights and rough terrain.Marianne Hessner, Brookline, Mass. In the late winter and early spring, the Grand Canyon is likely to fulfill your prerequisites of sunny and dry. It can, though, get chilly, especially at night. But stick to the South Rim, pack accordingly, and you'll have the benefit of fewer crowds, making it an optimal time to relax in the Grand Canyon's vast, quiet beauty. With so many national recreation areas nearby, you won't have far to go to expand your itinerary. In his ''36 Hours'' column (May 28, 2009), Brooks Barnes suggested a visit to the Kendrick Park WatchableWildlife Trail in the Coconino National Forest, south of the canyon, about 20 miles north of Flagstaff, Ariz. (wildlifeviewingareas.com). Two short trails offer opportunities to see coyotes, badgers and red-tailed hawks. Be advised that snow could still be falling, even in March; if you choose to embrace the weather, turn south of the Trail to Walker Lake for snowmobiling, snowboarding and cross-country skiing (fs.fed.us/r3/coconino/index.shtml). The Wupatki Pueblo (above), an 800-year-old former homestead of the Sinagua, Kayenta Anasazi and Cohonina peoples, is just northeast of Coconino and one of the area's ''cultural treasures,'' Mr. Barnes said. ''The remnants of 100 rooms remain, including a space that archaeologists identified as a ball court, similar to those found in pre-Columbian cultures.'' The remains of other historical pueblos can be found in the Wupatki National Monument area as well (nps.gov/wupa). For her article ''The Mighty Colorado at a Glide'' (May 12, 2010), Kate Siber kayaked a 15-mile stretch of the Colorado River, in Glen Canyon, about two and a half hours north of the Grand Canyon, where the ''sandy beaches, rich archaeological history and unspoiled scenery'' echo the portion that runs through the better-known stretch. This section is better for beginner boaters: There are no rapids, no special permit requirements and trips last only one or two days. A variety of rental companies offer both guided and self-guided trips, but be sure to check when they open for the season. Kayak Powell (kayakpowell.com), the company that Ms. Siber used, won't be operating until March 1 and even then, gloves and dry suits are necessary as the water is still extremely cold. Paddling downstream, Ms. Siber found an inscription in the rock of a natural amphitheater that dated back to an 1889 expedition and petroglyphs that were likely etched a millennium ago. At night, hundreds of stars were visible from the beach. For even clearer views of the constellations, head farther north to the Bryce Canyon Night Sky Sanctuary in Utah, about a five-hour drive from the Grand Canyon. Bryce Canyon National Park, filled with amphitheaters cut naturally out of eroding rock, offers multimedia astronomy shows by the park's rangers and volunteer astronomers, whom they call ''the Dark Rangers.'' The show is at 7 p.m. on Saturday nights during the winter (November through mid-March), followed by telescope viewing.

118450,357 words,Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City),NA,Tahoe regulators undecided on ski lift,2007,"STATELINE, Nev. (AP) -- Lake Tahoe land-use regulators approved a master plan update for Heavenly Mountain Ski Resort, but the fate of a proposed high-speed lift remained in limbo. After a daylong hearing Wednesday, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency governing board approved changes to allow new ski trails and lodges, a cross-country ski area, amphitheater and summer hiking trails. The resort owned by the Colorado-based Vail Resorts Inc. straddles the Nevada-California line at the south end of Lake Tahoe. But board members could not agree on what changes can occur at the North Bowl area on the resort's Nevada side, where Heavenly officials want to replace two aging chair lifts with a single, high-speed detachable quad. Environmentalists oppose the plan primarily because it would require the removal of more than 1,100 trees, including about 150 large, old-growth type trees up to or exceeding 2-feet thick. ""This has been politicized to the point we're not going to get there,"" said Blaise Carrig, Heavenly senior vice president and chief operating officer. ""We want to move on and I don't think we're going to move on any other way."" The agency left open the possibility the old lifts could be upgraded in their existing locations or that a new lift could be put up in a different alignment that would affect fewer trees. That project would have to come back for separate action. Speakers were divided between those that said proposed improvements are vital to keep Heavenly competitive as a world ski attraction and those that said cutting so many old-growth trees is unacceptable. ""This forest has never been cut. It survived the Comstock era"" when many of Tahoe's trees were clear-cut, said Jennifer Quashnick of the Tahoe Area SierraClub. ""You just don't find these in many places in the Tahoe Basin,"" she said. Chris Dunn, a ski resort designer who lives in Truckee, Calif., said Heavenly needs to upgrade if it wants to compete in the industry.

Any restaurant serving genetically engineered food must identify it on the menu. Europe has been unfriendly to modified foods for years. After protests, and with fears rising among consumers that such foods might cause biological and environmental damage, France, Italy and five other countries unofficially banned the sale of any new genetically altered crops five years ago. Products with modified ingredients have been sold before in the Union, which will expand to 25 members on May 1, from 15. But the first to be labeled as such, Butterfinger bars that were offered five years ago in supermarkets and stores in Germany, proved so unpopular that sales were halted within a year. To adjust to consumer preferences, Nestle and the Unilever food conglomerate allow no genetically engineered products in European markets. ""The company has found that customers reject modified products,"" said Elke Schmidt, a Nestle spokeswoman in Frankfurt. ""Consumer confidence is essential to us."" Geert Ritsema, who coordinates the campaign against genetically modified food and crops for FriendsoftheEarth Europe, headquartered in Brussels, said he approves the labeling of products. ""In general, we think this will give the consumer a better choice and a chance to avoid these foods if they don't want them,"" Mr. Ritsema said. The rules apply to any product -- cereal, frozen pizza, baby formula or whatever -- in which more than 0.9 percent of the ingredients have been genetically engineered. Each modified component must be marked in the ingredients list, including vegetable oil or sugars made from modified plants. Stefan Kern, a spokesman for the Kaufhof chain in Germany, said genetically modified food is not really an issue because customers will not buy it. ""We do not stock anything that has been altered,"" he said. Andrea Salarias, a restaurant manager in Barcelona, Spain, said Europeans implicitly expect food to be unaltered.

30510,1062 words,San Jose Mercury News (California),FRONT; Pg. 1A,PEREGRINE FALCONS CLAW THEIR WAY BACK THEY ARE BEING REMOVED FROM THE FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST,1999,"The world's fastest bird, the peregrine falcon, is officially flying off the endangered species list, marking a dramatic recovery that was aided largely by Santa Cruz biologists. Today's scheduled announcement caps a painstaking, 30-year effort to save a crow-sized raptor that had teetered on the brink of extinction. Their numbers decimated by pesticide poisoning, the falcons totaled as few as 39 nesting pairs in the continental United States in the 1970s. Scientists across the country, including a team at the University of California-Santa Cruz, literally went out onto limbs to rescue eggs doomed by abnormally thin shells. Now 1,650 pairs of peregrine falcons take wing across the United States and Canada. ""In the last 30 years of bird conservation in the United States, there's been no greater success story than the peregrine falcon,"" said Dan Taylor, California director of the NationalAudubonSociety. ""It shows that the law can work if there's the resources and political will to make it happen."" U.S. Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt is scheduled to officially declare the falcon's removal from the endangered list today in Boise, Idaho. Speaking with reporters Thursday from Denver, Babbitt said the falcon is proof that the 1973 Endangered Species Act is effective. ""The message is that the Endangered Species Act works,"" Babbitt said. ""It is an important commitment from the American people that we can protect creation and live in balance."" The peregrine falcon is the ninth American species to be removed from the endangered list because its population has recovered, and the first bird to be ""de-listed"" nationwide. Other species declared recovered include the American alligator in 1987 and the gray whale in 1994. The peregrine falcon was among several birds that were poisoned to near extinction by the pesticide DDT. Their rebound began after the chemical was banned in 1972. When the peregrine falcon was listed for federal protection in 1970, there were only two breeding pairs in California. Today, there are 167 pairs. While banning DDT was crucial to halting further damage to the falcons, their recovery depended upon the captive breeding and reintroduction efforts of biologists and falconers, who use them to hunt other fowl, Babbitt said. The Endangered Species Act contributed funding to that $32 million effort as well as protection of the falcon's nesting sites, he said. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the agency charged with the protectionand recovery of endangered species, said that Santa Cruz researchers were critical to the falcon's recovery. UC-Santa Cruz's Predatory Bird Research Group -- whose members are in Idaho for today's announcement -- was among three organizations credited for nursing the falcon population back to health. ""They've been vital in the recovery effort,"" Wildlife Service spokeswoman Cindy Hoffman said. The other two groups credited for the falcon's recovery were the Peregrine Fund World Center for Birds of Prey in Boise and the Southeastern Raptor Center in Auburn, Ala. Reversing the ravages of DDT was a delicate process. DDT, a wonder chemical of the 1940s used to wipe out disease-bearing mosquitoes, accumulates in birds' tissues as they eat tainted prey. The poisoned birds laid eggs with paper-thin shells that easily cracked and spoiled. To save the falcons, biologists sneaked up to their nests -- often perched upon precarious cliffs -- while the mother birds were out hunting. They removed the thin-shelled eggs, replaced them with fake ones and incubated the real eggs back at the lab. When the eggs hatched, the scientists slipped the fledglings back into the nest. The unsuspecting mother would return, assume her eggs had hatched and care for her young. When the peregrine falcon was proposed for de-listing last year, some conservationists argued it should be changed to threatened status rather than lose protection. But Babbitt noted that the falcon remains protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and that its numbers will be monitored for at least five years. The peregrine falcon's adaptability helped greatly in its recovery, Babbitt said. Many now soar among the skyscrapers of major cities, hunting pigeons. Along with the peregrine falcon, the other birds hardest hit by DDT were the bald eagle and the brown pelican, which also have bounced back since the pesticide was outlawed. The bald eagle was proposed for removal from the endangered species list in July, and the brown pelican has been declared recovered along the Atlantic and eastern Gulf coasts. With its slate-gray back and creamy breast, the peregrine falcon preys upon smaller birds, diving at speeds up to 275 mph to catch them. They have been known to inhabit every continent except Antarctica. The American subspecies, also known as ""duck hawks,"" were once shot as pests, but the birds have been revered for centuries by falconers. There are 1,181 plants and animals protected under the Endangered Species Act, the Wildlife Service's Hoffman said. About half of those listed before 1989 have stabilized or improved. Also removed because of recovery are the Arctic subspecies of peregrine falcon, three birds from the Pacific island of Palau, three Australian kangaroos and one plant, the Ryd- berg milk vetch.","['been', 'said', 'show', 'work', 'mak', 'hap', 'is', 'scheduled', 'decl', 'remov', 'endang', 'speak', 'thursday', 'said', 'is', 'endang', 'is']",91,17,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,['speak'],1,[],0,"['said', 'decl', 'said']",3,4
144877,811 words,Portland Press Herald (Maine),FRONT; Pg. A1,Democrats draw a line on nominee to lead DEP,2011,"Gov. Paul LePage's nominee to lead the state Department of Environmental Protection ran into opposition Tuesday from Democrats on a key legislative panel. After five hours of public testimony, the Legislature's Environment and Natural Resources Committee voted 9-4 along party lines to endorse Darryl Brown as the department's new commissioner. It was the first time that a committee has not given unanimous approval to a LePage appointee and signals that Brown could face serious opposition Thursday when the Senate votes on his nomination. The debate over Brown's appointment also serves as a precursor to the looming political fight over LePage's plan to make sweeping changes to Maine's environmental laws. Much of the questioning Tuesday focused on ethical issues. Brown is the sole owner of Main-Land Development Consultants Inc., which helps developers win permits from local boards and the Department of Environmental Protection. Its current clients include Black Bear Entertainment, which is building a casino in Oxford. Democrats are particularly concerned that Brown would not be able to assure the public that the agency could be impartial when making decisions that would affect his company or his clients. Sen. Seth Goodall, D-Richmond, said he voted to oppose Brown's appointment because he was unsatisfied with the nominee's proposal for distancing himself from the company. Goodall said Brown's plan would put the department ''under a cloud'' of suspicion. Several people, however, testified to Brown's character and urged lawmakers to take him at his word that he would not benefit financially from his position. ''Darryl Brown does not do favors,'' said his longtime friend and former Republican legislator Porter Leighton of Falmouth. ''The very best defense is character, and he has it in abundance.'' Brown said he plans to sell the company, which is based in Livermore Falls and has 11 employees. If confirmed, he intends to resign as president and establish a board of directors to run the company and negotiate the sale. The company's staff would be prohibited from lobbying the state for any rule changes, he said. In addition, the company would only supply him with general information about its performance and would not discuss specific clients. Moreover, Brown said he would recuse himself from the review of any permit applications that his company has before the DEP. The company typically gets eight permits a year from the department. Brown's plan, however, doesn't go far enough because there is no formal process that requires him to sell the company, said Greg Cunningham, an attorney for the ConservationLawFoundation. ''The fact is, in the absence of complete divestiture, Mr. Brown will literally profit from his company's work with the very rules, staff and administrative processes overseen by Mr. Brown,'' he said. Cunningham and Goodall said Brown should create a ''blind trust,'' in which a trustee would be charged with selling the company. In a blind trust, a third party has total discretion to make investments on behalf of a beneficiary while the beneficiary is uninformed about the holdings of the trust. Clint Boothby, an attorney for Brown, said a blind trust is unacceptable because Brown needs to know the conditions of any sale of his company, which he started in 1974. Brown told the committee that his retirement income depends on the proceeds of the sale, and it may take some time to find a buyer because he doesn't want to sell at a ''fire sale'' price. Danny Shaw, co-owner of Shaw Brothers Construction in Gorham, said he doubts the premise that Brown's company would benefit if Brown headed the DEP. He said Main-Land Development Consultants would be under such public scrutiny that many developers would avoid hiring the company. ''To think he is going to gain from this is crazy,'' Shaw told lawmakers. Democrats also questioned Brown about his involvement in LePage's long list of proposed changes to environmental regulations, including repealing laws that require manufacturers to take back recyclable goods for disposal and reversing a ban on the use of a chemical linked to cancer in children's products. Democrats appeared relieved when Brown said he was not involved in creating the package of proposals. Brown said he wants to make the department more responsive to the business community, with the goal of creating ''more jobs and better jobs.'' At the same time, he said, he would also work to maintain the quality of Maine's natural environment. In answers to lawmakers' questions, he said he supports nuclear power and drilling offshore for oil because it would make Maine less dependent on foreign oil. While pollution is a factor in global warming, he said, cyclical natural causes are playing a larger role.

163940,566 words,The Philadelphia Inquirer,BUSINESS; P-com Biz; Pg. A09,Natural-gas firms have paid nearly $200 million under Act 13,2012,"Natural-gas companies have paid nearly $200 million to Pennsylvania's Public Utility Commission to meet the requirements of the impact fee imposed by Act 13. The PUC released the numbers Monday, 10 days after the deadline for companies to send checks. When the legislation was being debated, lawmakers came up with an initial estimate of $180 million in revenue. The current tally, however, shows $205.9 million owed and $197.6 million paid. Some companies are disputing the amount they owe; others have not responded to letters and reminders from the commission, PUC spokeswoman Jennifer Kocher said. The Marcellus Shale Coalition, an industry group, termed the amount ""staggering by any measure."" ""At a time when budget shortfalls are stretching state and local governments to their limits, responsible American natural-gas production is helping to support tens of thousands of good jobs and providing enormous, much-needed revenues for critical services,"" said Kathryn Klaber, coalition president. Nevertheless, she said, the amount ""serves as a stark reminder that we must ensure that we have commonsense policies in place, especially local zoning uniformity, at the center of Act 13, which encourage economic growth, job creation, and additional revenue."" George Jugovic Jr., president and CEO of the environmental group CitizensforPennsylvania'sFuture, said the roughly $200 million ""doesn't look like that much"" if all of the potential impacts of gas drilling are taken into account. Considering an estimated $3 million to $8 million per mile to build a two-lane rural road, he said, the amount ""doesn't seem to be such a large pot from which to draw money to compensate for impacts of the industry."" ""Of course, that assumes that the real intent of the fee was to address many of the impacts, and I don't think that was the real intent,"" Jugovic said. ""The end game was a political compromise."" Statewide, 4,034 horizontal wells and 419 vertical wells fell under the Act 13 provisions, signed into law Feb. 14. The fee is based on the number of wells drilled, the types of wells, and how much they produced. The PUC will distribute the money to counties and municipalities, with additional money going for statewide projects. The PUC did not release a tally of how much each county will get. But Doug McLinko, chairman of the Bradford County commissioners, said he expected about $12 million for local coffers. Of that, McLinko said, the county likely will get about $8 million, amounting to 14 percent of its annual $57 million budget. The commissioners expect to use it to pay off the county's debt and reduce property taxes by perhaps 6 percent per taxpayer. Any funds left will help create jobs ""to someday cut more taxes,"" he said, adding that natural gas has been ""a boon to the county."" Bradford is the most-drilled county in the state, McLinko said, with 962 wells - basically every well drilled since 2008 - subject to Act 13 provisions. That amounts to nearly one well per square mile. Companies paying the largest sums to the PUC are: Chesapeake Appalachia, $30,840,000; Talisman Energy USA Inc., $26,440,000; and Range Resources Appalachia L.L.C., $23,670,000. Among the companies that have not responded is Carrizo (Marcellus) L.L.C., which the PUC lists as owing $3,050,000.

37254,1431 words,Contra Costa Times (California),BREAKING; My Town; Alameda; Solano; Environment; Commuting; Contra Costa; News; National; Local,"Crude-by-rail: One federal inspector oversees all California's railroad bridges, no state oversight",2014,"As concerns grow over aging rail infrastructure, earthquake readiness and a dramatic increase in crude oil shipments by train, state railroad regulators are scrambling to hire their first-ever railroad bridge inspectors -- two of them. Once they are hired, the California Public Utilities Commission plans to create a state railroad bridge inventory to determine which are most at risk. That's right -- neither the state nor federal government has a list of railroad bridges for California or the rest of the country. Until that happens, the safety of California's thousands of railroad bridges -- key conduits that carry people and hazardous materials over environmentally sensitive ecosystems and near urban areas -- is left up to rail line owners and a single federal inspector who splits his time among 11 states. ""Two more inspectors is better than none, but it's really a Band-Aid,"" said Suma Peesapati, attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental group fighting the oil rail influx. ""I think there should be no crude by rail over those bridges until there's a comprehensive look at all of them."" No California rail bridges have failed in recent memory, but the 6.0 earthquake that rattled the Napa area on Aug. 24 provided a reminder that California must monitor its aging rail infrastructure. Following the quake, the Federal Railroad Administration worked with Caltrans to contact railroads within a 100-mile radius and ensure bridges and tracks were inspected for damage before resuming normal operations. The Napa Valley Wine Train, which was closed for two days after the quake, had its own private inspector go over the tracks and numerous bridges, including one traversing Highway 29. The inspector gave the green light to continue running Aug. 26. Caltrans employs 120 inspectors and 80 specialty personnel to inspect the state's public automobile highway bridges to ensure the integrity of the elevated structures, in comparison to the one federal inspector for all of California's rail bridges, most of which are privately owned. Those railroad bridges are inspected, maintained and regulated by company personnel, but watchdogs say that's far from adequate. In its annual Railroad Safety Activity Report to the state Legislature in November, the CPUC identified the state's railroad bridges as a ""potential significant rail safety risk."" ""There are many unknown questions regarding bridge integrity that need to be answered to ensure public safety,"" the report found. The Benicia-Martinez Rail Drawbridge, built in 1930 and tucked between the automobile spans, carries hazardous material shipments across the Carquinez Strait to East Bay refineries, along with 30 Amtrak Capitol Corridor passenger trains each weekday. The bridge is owned by Union Pacific and is safe, the company's spokesman said. ""We regularly inspect all of our bridges in California,"" said Union Pacific's Aaron Hunt. ""We perform necessary maintenance required to assure the safe use of our bridges. Bridges and culverts are a critical part of our 32,000-mile network."" Union Pacific has spent more than $42 billion on infrastructure, Hunt said, not specifying what portion of that was devoted to bridges, including $4.1 billion scheduled for this year. ""These are private investments, not taxpayer dollars,"" he said. However, the state report found many bridges are owned by smaller short-line railroads that ""may not be willing or able to acquire the amount of capital needed to repair or replace degrading bridges."" Crude by rail Concern has grown about bridge safety and rail safety in general with the increase of crude oil shipments by rail. They've jumped 158 percent in California from just September to December 2013, according to the state energy commission. This year, the CPUC created the Crude Oil Reconnaissance Team to monitor the oil-by-train boom to ensure federal and state safety laws are followed. In June, federal rail chief Joseph Szabo spoke to an Indiana newspaper about the crude-by-rail boom: ""The movement of this product is a game changer. We have to rethink everything we've done and known in the past about safety."" In response to the increase and some deadly accidents, including a derailment last summer in Quebec, Canada, that killed 47 people, the U.S. Department of Transportation proposed tank car safety upgrades. As of now, about 100 rail cars of crude roll through populated areas of the East Bay each week along the BNSF line from Stockton to Kinder Morgan's rail depot in Richmond. The route traverses the 1,690-foot-long, 80-foot-high Muir Trestle, above Alhambra Avenue in Martinez. The trestle was constructed in 1899 and rebuilt 30 years later. Those rail cars rumble through Antioch, Pittsburg, Bay Point, Martinez, and Hercules, said Contra Costa Hazardous Materials chief Randy Sawyer. Aging Based on total track miles and federal estimates of a bridge occurring every 1.25 miles of track, the CPUC estimates there are about 5,000 California railroad bridges. Most are old steel and timber structures built more than 100 years ago, and ""actual railroad bridge plans or records are either absent or unreliable,"" the CPUC report found. ""It's part of the infrastructure that's dilapidated, not only in California, but across the country,"" Peesapati said. ""Bridges are really an example of the problem."" American Society of Civil Engineers past President Andy Herrmann, a bridge consultant, said companies balk at releasing bridge data for competitive reasons, but he believes bridges are maintained safely. ""There's a very strong profit motive to keep the bridges open,"" Herrmann said. ""Detours will cost them a fortune."" However, the 2007 Government Accountability Office report also found that ""Because bridge and tunnel work is costly, railroads typically make other investments to improve mobility first."" Are they safe? In 1991, a freight train traversing steep switchbacks in Dunsmuir, Siskiyou County, derailed, sending rail cars tumbling off a bridge and resulting in 19,000 gallons of metam sodium, a concentrated herbicide, leaking into the upper Sacramento River. The accident killed all vegetation, fish and other aquatic animals 45 miles downstream, rendering some invertebrate species extinct. Several hundred people exposed to the contaminated water required medical treatment in what's still considered the worst inland ecological disaster in the state. Although the accident was not caused by bridge failure, it led the railroad to build a derailment barrier on the Cantara Loop bridge to prevent it happening again. And the Federal Railroad Administration expressed concern about the condition of bridges generally in a wide-ranging review after the crash. ""The review was prompted by the agency's perception that the bridge population was aging, traffic density and loads were increasing on many routes, and the consequences of a bridge failure could be catastrophic,"" according to a report published in 1991, the same year as the crash. From 1982 to 2008, records show there were 58 train accidents nationwide caused by the structural failure of a railroad bridge, causing nine injuries and about $26.5 million in damages. State hires As of July 2010, new federal rules require rail companies prepare bridge management programs -- including annual inspections, maintenance inventories and more -- that are made available to federal inspectors when asked. The Federal Railroad Administration can levy fines up to $100,000 for failure to comply. Federal inspectors audit railroad bridge inspections done by the companies and personally perform observations of 225 to 250 bridges each year. Based on those CPUC calculations, it would take the California inspector 20 years to visit and observe all of the state's estimated 5,000 bridges, if that was all he had to do. But in reality, it would take much longer because California's inspector splits his time among 11 states, leaving the CPUC to conclude in its 2013 report that the feds ""cannot provide adequate oversight."" That shortfall prompted state regulators to hire their own bridge inspectors, and they have already designed a bridge evaluation form and experimented with performing inspections. ""Railroad bridges carry thousands of cars of hazardous materials and thousands of passengers daily,"" said CPUC spokesman Christopher Chow. ""The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) has new, general bridge regulations ... but employs only five inspectors for the entire U.S. The CPUC's bridge inspectors will be able to augment the FRA's efforts.""

134309,729 words,San Jose Mercury News (California),FRONT; Pg. 1A,STREISAND'S HOME: A SUIT IS BORN; STAR CLAIMS WEB PHOTO OF HER MALIBU MANSION VIOLATES PRIVACY,2003,"Barbra Streisand thinks that people, people who fly past her house with cameras, are the nosiest people in the world. Claiming her privacy was violated, the diva actress and singer has filed a $10 million lawsuit against Silicon Valley millionaire and environmentalist Ken Adelman. The suit demands that he remove an aerial photograph of her oceanfront Malibu mansion from his Web site (www.californiacoastline.org). Adelman, a Watsonville resident who owns four electric cars and the largest collection of solar panels on any home in California, made national news six months ago when he and his wife, Gabrielle, photographed the entire California coastline from a small helicopter -- one picture every 500 feet -- and put it on the site. The site now contains 12,200 photos featuring everything from the Golden Gate Bridge to Hearst Castle. It has won praise from the SierraClub and other environmental groups as a way to document violations of coastal building laws, as well as erosion and other natural changes. But Streisand, in a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, says the site violates California's ""anti-paparazzi"" law. The suit notes that Adelman did not ask permission to take a photo of her house, which is identified on the Web site. And because he took it from a helicopter with a Nikon digital camera, his photo shows details -- from her swimming pool to lawn furniture -- that cannot be seen from the road or the beach below. Privacy right asserted ""What Barbra seeks to vindicate is a basic right of privacy,"" said herattorney, Rex Glensy, of Santa Monica. Streisand, 61, whose resume includes an Oscar, eight Grammies and 47 gold records, wants the photo removed and $10 million in damages, which she says she will donate to charity. Adelman, 39, says things will remain the way they were. ""The purpose of the Web site is to provide a record of the whole coast of California,"" he said. ""We can't provide an exemption for rich coastal landowners."" He shot the photo in September from 577 feet while taking thousands of similar shots, he said, using a zoom lens at 65 millimeters. He did not use a telephoto lens. ""I don't need permission to take a picture of her house if it is taken from a public place,"" he said. ""And the airspace is a public place."" Adelman came to California in the late 1980s from Connecticut and founded TGV Software in Santa Cruz. He sold the firm to Cisco Systems. He then co-founded another company, Network Alchemy, and sold it to Nokia. Together, both companies sold for nearly $500 million, although Adelman split the proceeds with other founders. Streisand has identified herself with environmental causes, including paying to send global warming activists to Kyoto, Japan, for a world environmental conference. ""It is inconceivable to me that someone who proclaims herself an environmentalist would threaten to dismantle one of the greatest high-tech projects to protect the California coast,"" said SierraClub attorney Mark Massara. ""At some point, someone needs to sit her down and tell her the public interest is at stake here."" Adelman sells photos from the Web site for $50 each. Proceeds go to the California Coastal Protection Network, a Santa Barbara group that advocates for public access to beaches and an end to offshore oil drilling. Other defendants in the case are Layer42.net, of Santa Clara, which provides Web hosting services for the site, and Pictopia.com, of Emeryville, which provides prints of the photographs. Law about people Will the Web site stay, or become a misty, water-colored memory? ""I would say she has zero chance of winning,"" said attorney Terry Francke, of the California First Amendment Coalition in Sacramento. ""The law of privacy, even the paparazzi extensions of it, is not about taking pictures of structures. It is about people."" No people can be made out in the Streisand home photo. But Streisand argues that people generally don't have access to helicopters. ""You can't see her house from the beach or from the road,"" her attorney said. ""In fact the only way to achieve what he did is to fly around in a helicopter and take a picture with a 6 megapixel camera. The picture goes into places that no one can see. And he identifies the location of her home. She finds all of these things objectionable.""","['has', 'won', 'docu', 'fil', 'county', 'say', 'viol', 'not', 'did', 'ask', 'tak', 'is', 'ident', 'took', 'show', 'swim', 'lawn', 'be', 'seen', 'is', 'proclaim', 'threaten', 'dismantl', 'protect', 'said', 'nee', 'sit', 'tel', 'is', 'sel', 'go', 'advoc', 'offsh']",195,33,"['ident', 'sit']",2,"['viol', 'threaten', 'sit']",3,['fil'],1,['fil'],1,[],0,['ident'],1,"['protect', 'advoc']",2,"['say', 'not', 'ask', 'said', 'advoc']",5,15
96852,513 words,The Washington Post,A SECTION; Pg. A19; THE FEDERAL PAGE; IN BRIEF,IN BRIEF,1999,"Campground Workers Due Raises After the Forest Service failed to win an exemption from a prevailing-wage law, pay will increase--and in some cases nearly double--for workers at hundreds of campgrounds. The change could make for unhappy campers. Businesses that run most of the campgrounds may have to boost overnight camping fees, which now range from $ 7 to $ 15. Concessionaires do not know where they will need to raise fees or by how much. ""It will kill this industry relatively quickly,"" said Pat O'Brien of the National Forest Recreation Association. ""It's a very thin margin."" The Forest Service agrees that fees could increase and says the agency will take a cut in its $ 2 million in annual camping revenue. That reduction, while only a fraction of the agency's budget, could add to a maintenance backlog in forest areas. ""It is a very big concern,"" said Kenneth Karkula, concessions program manager for the agency. Forest Service employees used to run the agency's 4,000 campgrounds, but when federal funding for forest recreation declined in the 1970s, concessionaires were hired. Today, about 70 percent of the campgrounds are run by private companies. The businesses generally pay minimum wage or slightly more. But in 1995, while reviewing campground concessions, the Labor Department found that concessionaires should have been paying prevailing wages. The Labor Department denied the Forest Service's appeal late last year, rejecting its argument that campground concessionaires should be treated the same as motel concessionaires who may pay minimum wage. The Forest Service will put the higher wages into effect next month. It will take five years for the increase to reach all workers, who will see their pay increase $ 1 to $ 5 per hour. The Recreation Roundtable, a group of chief executives for large recreation companies, wants Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to appeal the Labor Department decision. But the Forest Service, which is part of USDA, said it has no plans for appeals or legislation. Logging Test in Grand Canyon Park The National Park Service hopes to experiment with tree-cutting in Grand Canyon National Park to see if it will improve the overall health of the forest. If allowed this summer, it apparently will be the first logging in any of America's 52 national parks. ""What this is, is a very small-scale research project to test four methods of restoration,"" a Grand Canyon spokeswoman said. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said the experiment is necessary because ""for many years we suppressed naturally occurring fire and, without meaning to, created artificial, unhealthy and dangerous forests."" Environmentalists agree something must be done but fear too many trees will be cut. ""You can always cut down more trees, but you can't put them back,"" said Sharon Galbreath of the SierraClub. Park biologist R.V. Ward said plan is to cut about 8,000 trees. ""More have been cut in road-widening projects,"" he said.

5570,1045 words,The Chronicle of Philanthropy,SPECIAL REPORT; Pg. e05 Vol. 20 No. 16,Peace and Quiet,2008,"Six groups have joined to create a fund that will teach workers to engage in ""contemplative practices,"" in an effort to encourage collaboration and prevent burnout among employees of charities that promote social change. Last November, the newly formed Seasons Fund for Social Transformation awarded $449,000 in grants to 15 organizations to support education retreats, meditation, yoga, and other relaxation and communication techniques. And Seasons is poised to grow this year with the addition of five to 10 more foundations and grants totaling up to $1.5-million, according to Simon Greer, president of the Jewish Funds for Justice, which manages the Seasons Fund. The ultimate goal is to raise $5-million over the next 18 months, according to Michael Edwards, director of the governance and civil-society program at the Ford Foundation, and one of the founding members of Seasons. To that end, Seasons will make a presentation in New York at the Ford Foundation next month, at which grantee organizations will speak about their work and programs before an audience of prospective supporters. The other groups that have supported Seasons so far are the Fetzer Institute, in Kalamazoo, Mich.; the Hidden Leaf Foundation, in Concord, Calif.; the Seeds of Justice Fund, in Santa Cruz, Calif.; and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, in Battle Creek, Mich. Inside and Out ""Contemplative practices"" describes exercises and techniques designed to heighten and improve self-awareness, focus, interconnectedness, compassion, and communication, according to the Center for Contemplative Mind in Society, in Northampton, Mass. The center received $20,000 from the Seasons Fund to offer retreats to social-justice workers. ""One of the most potent approaches is guiding people and getting them in touch with their own personal purpose and vision, and then helping them create an alignment between what they really value and what they're trying to manifest in the world,"" says Tara Brown, director of the Hidden Leaf Foundation and co-chair of the Seasons Fund. In addition to such inward-looking activities as meditation and yoga, other contemplative practices supported by the Seasons Fund include some that focus especially on communication. Staff retreats in which employees can discuss their work and forge alliances with individuals at other nonprofit groups are another important component. Employees of social-change groups especially need these exercises, say David A. Brown, Tara Brown's father and founder of Hidden Leaf, because the traditional approaches to social change have been adversarial. ""It is set up as we versus they, these little grass-roots nonprofit organizations vying with the whole structure of our system,"" he says. With the competition comes anger and frustration, and burnout soon follows. When staff members learn to communicate collaboratively, Mr. Brown says, they can cooperate instead of fighting or competing. Mr. Edwards says incorporating contemplative practices can greatly increase the impact of social-change organizations. ""It increases their effectiveness, their ability to build alliances, it reduces burnout, it helps teams come together, and it helps individuals confront some of the barriers that get in the way of working together more effectively,"" he says. Building Alliances One group confronting such barriers and building alliances is ForestEthics, with headquarters in San Francisco, which has received $30,000 from Seasons. ForestEthics aggressively campaigns against polluters and companies that endanger the environment. However, its director, Todd Paglia, says the group first attempts to build relationships with executives at those corporations to help them change their policies in a collaborative way. ""Our job from the get-go is not to challenge them or try and threaten them, but it's to get to know them and to educate them and hopefully change them in some of the places they're having an impact,"" he says. ""Our approach is to be hard on the issues and soft on the people."" One of the group's recent successes was persuading Limited Brands, parent company of Victoria's Secret, to cancel a major paper contract with the West Fraser Timber Company, headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, which uses timber from forests where endangered caribou live, according to ForestEthics. Limited Brands also started using recycled paper in its catalogs and became a partner with ForestEthics in lobbying the Canadian government to adopt more environmentally friendly policies. Mr. Paglia plans to use the Seasons grant to send staff members to the Rockwood Leadership Institute, in Berkeley, Calif., another Seasons Fund grantee, as well as to develop other training programs. He is emphatic that these practices make a difference, saying that detractors may see these efforts as ""hippie-dippy sort of stuff, but it's actually one the keys to, for example, ForestEthics protecting 12 million acres over the last several years. It's bottom-line effectiveness, to say nothing of people leading a better life."" As for that better life, Akaya Windwood, president of Rockwood, says that nonprofit employees tend to put their groups' missions ahead of caring for themselves, which can end up hurting their ability to carry out their missions. ""We've seen burnout, bitterness, leaders who would be better leaders if they actually did only work 40 hours a week instead of 60 hours,"" she says. Contemplative practice, she says, is about ""taking care of yourself in service of the work. It's not a self-indulgent thing."" Personal Connections Most foundations became involved in the Seasons Fund through a personal connection: Guillermina Hernandez-Gallegos, formerly at the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and now a senior program officer at the Fetzer Institute, and Mr. Edwards of Ford both had interest in contemplative practices and social transformation, which prompted their involvement. Mr. Edwards says he began meditating in 1982. ""The fact that we try to live out the philosophy that we're also encouraging in others gives us more strength and legitimacy, and makes us more attractive as a group,"" he says. The Ford Foundation has thus far contributed $500,000 to Seasons, and Mr. Edwards says he is recommending a $1-million matching grant from Ford for the next round.","['confront', 'is', 'has', 'receiv', 'endang', 'say', 'attempt', 'build', 'help', 'chang', 'is', 'challeng', 'try', 'threaten', 'get', 'know', 'educ', 'chang', 'hav', 'say', 'is', 'be', 'was', 'persuad', 'cancel', 'headquart', 'us', 'endang', 'accord', 'start', 'us', 'becam', 'lobby', 'adopt', 'mr', 'us', 'grant', 'send', 'fund', 'develop', 'is', 'mak', 'say', 'see', 'protect', 'say', 'lead', 'say', 'tend', 'put', 'car', 'end', 'hurt', 'carry', 'wev', 'seen', 'be', 'did', 'say']",334,59,['persuad'],1,['threaten'],1,"['lobby', 'adopt', 'fund']",3,[],0,['fund'],1,['educ'],1,"['build', 'grant', 'protect']",3,"['say', 'say', 'say', 'say', 'say', 'say']",6,16

42041,1205 words,Chicago Daily Herald,NEWS; Pg. 1,40% of the food in the U.S. goes to trash What a waste And what waste agencies in the suburbs are tryingto do to keep food out of landfills,2012,"On the big platter of possibilities being considered to reduce the amount of trash being dumped in Lake County landfills, food scraps could be the main course. ""It's the largest single item in the waste stream to target right now,"" said Walter Willis, executive director of the Solid Waste Agency of Lake County. ""It's approximately 12-13 percent of what we put in our landfills."" Conserving landfill space is environmentally sound, keeps garbage disposal rates fairly stable and reduces heat-trapping methane, a greenhouse gas. With a mission to slash landfill deposits by a third by 2020, SWALCO considers food scrap collection a promising avenue of pursuit. ""I think attacking the food scraps will be one of the most effective ways of reaching those goals,"" Willis said. There is a lot to gather. The NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncil estimates 40 percent of all food in the U.S. goes to waste, and the average American throws away about 20 pounds of food each month. While some commercial entities are making inroads, food scrap collection is in its infancy in Lake County and surrounding areas. Residential programs are virtually nonexistent. Willis says a residential test program remains a goal for this year, but it likely will be a while before Lake County residents on a widespread basis are saving dinner plate remnants to be blended into nutrient-rich compost. ""I've got a couple of towns that have expressed some interest, but nobody said, 'Hey, let's do it,'"" Willis said. Those involved in collecting and composting food scraps say public education, plus the involvement of waste haulers and large producers such as grocery stores, will be key. ""We have to get everybody on the same page,"" said Ted Krueger, president and CEO of Midwest Organics near Wauconda, one of two facilities in Lake County with a state permit to mix food scraps with landscape waste. ""There needs to be a lot of training before residential gets started."" Composting food waste wasn't allowed in Illinois until Jan. 1, 2010. The rationale was to make it easier to start large-scale composting operations that would create jobs and build a market for compost. In 2010, Barrington was the first Illinois town to try a pilot residential collection for food scraps. Only about a third of the 300 targeted households participated, and costs were high, due to a lack of facilities that could accept food scraps. The Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County, which coordinated the pilot, recommended against continuing or expanding it. To make residential food scrap collection viable, scraps need to be collected from the really big producers: grocery stores, restaurants, institutions and schools, SWANCC reported. Getting the big generators on board is a challenge, Willis says. ""Some are working better than others, but right now it is fair to say we are in an experimentation period where the industry is trying to find the most cost-effective approach,"" he said. Mary Allen, SWANCC's recycling and education coordinator, said the agency continues to consider ways to offer it on a wider scale. ""There are a lot of cities in the U.S. and Europe that have been doing it a very long time,"" she said. About 150 communities in North America collect scraps. Among them is San Francisco, which is heading toward a goal of zero waste by 2020. The city created the first large-scale urban food scrap collection and made it mandatory in 2009, meaning that everyone must separate refuse into recyclable materials, compostable material and trash. Curbside food scrap recycling also is available to 90 percent of the single-family homes in King County, Washington, which includes Seattle, as well as some neighborhoods in Minneapolis. More than 80 percent of food scrap programs are located in just three states -- Washington, Minnesota and California, according to BioCycle magazine. In Grayslake, about 75 residents at the Prairie Crossing subdivision contribute their scraps each week to the Prairie Crossing Learning Farm. ""Just like recycling so many years ago, people have to learn,"" said Eric Carlberg, farm manager. Last winter, food scrap disposal was initiated at Great Lakes Naval Station. Scraps from the mess halls and kitchens are ground and placed into a sealed container that is taken to Midwest Organics, which counts the Chicago Botanic Garden among its big customers for compost. ""We're just looking for ways more and more to reduce our solid waste and recycle as much as we can,"" said Dave Jensen, recycling program manager. Next week, Oak Park will begin a voluntary food scrap composting pilot program for about 1,300 homes on one landscape waste route. For $12 a month, participants get a 96-gallon cart for organic materials, including yard waste and food scraps. ""It is the trend of the future,"" said Karen Rozmus, Oak Park environmental services manager. ""We're going to be watching very closely."" Rosmus said other local communities are very interested in seeing what happens. As the agency that oversees waste disposal and recycling, SWALCO was directed by the Lake County Board to dramatically increase the recycling rate to 60 percent from about 39 percent by 2020. A ""60 Percent Recycling Task Force"" met for more than a year and emerged last fall with 36 recommendations for the residential, commercial, and construction and demolition sectors. Because it is easier to measure how much material goes into landfills than how much is recycled, the goal is to get Lake County residents to throw away less, the agency determined. Those recommendations range from enhancing existing recycling programs to eventually enacting mandatory measures, including for food scrap collection, if voluntary participation doesn't work. Based on the knowledge gained from a residential pilot program and the available capacity to dispose of the scraps, officials by the summer of 2013 would decide whether to expand the practice. So while food scraps may be the low-hanging fruit of the waste diversion stream, efforts to harvest it are evolving. Willis estimated the maturity of the effort at 2 or 3 on a scale of 10. ""It's not going to be tomorrow, but it's moving in that direction,"" says Joe Zepada, CEO of Nu-Earth Organics in Waukegan, which secured a state permit last summer to compost food scraps with landscape waste into compost. In its first full season, Nu-Earth has gotten close to 50 tons of foods scraps a week, according to Zepada, all from commercial sources including Costco and Wal-Mart. But so few composters exist, it's hard to get the program going, Zepada said. Whole Foods started a program about a year ago that now has been expanded to at least eight Chicago area stores. The practice has lowered the amount of waste taken to landfills from 90 percent to 10 percent, according to the chain. Jewel-Osco began food scrap recycling last November at three stores in Bloomington-Normal and quickly added 18 more locations, including Lake Forest and Lake Zurich. As of last week, however, the chain announced that five of the programs, including the two in Lake County, were canceled due to ""issues"" the company declined to discuss. ""We think this whole thing is a challenge,"" said John Dunsing, who coordinates the program for Jewel-Osco. ""It's just so new.""","['estim', 'goe', 'wast', 'throws', 'ar', 'mak', 'is', 'surround', 'ar', 'say', 'remain', 'be', 'ar', 'sav', 'be', 'blend']",90,16,[],0,['surround'],1,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,['say'],1,2
78318,629 words,Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News,STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS,"Media lap up street scene: Fewer journalists and protesters this time, but still barking aplenty",2007,"Dec. 11--Yesterday was one of the dog days of journalism. What else can you say when the sentencing of suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick attracts twice as many reporters as protesters? Fortunately, both sides were thrown a bone during yesterday morning's sparsely attended street theater in Richmond, which drew half the satellite television trucks, a fraction of the police force and significantly fewer street protesters than the carnival atmosphere that accompanied Vick's plea hearing in August. The 130 or so reporters, cameramen and TV producers who converged on the federal courthouse had actual news to report -- Vick's sentence of 23 months in prison for dogfighting. And the 65 or so protesters -- equally divided between animal-rights proponents and a busload of singing members of Vick's church in Hampton -- did not have to compete too hard for the attention of content-starved media outlets outside. Befitting the occasion, it was a protesting pooch that stole the spotlight. A small, mixed-breed beagle was stationed across Main Street from the entrance to the courthouse. It sported a wooden sandwich board on its 15-pound frame that stated: ""Dogfighters use dogs like me for bait."" Yesterday's sentencing was another opportunity for folks at the HumaneSociety of the United States and PeoplefortheEthicalTreatmentofAnimals to spread their message. Several dozen PETA supporters showed up holding signs depicting mutilated canines that stated: ""Dogs Deserve Justice."" ""We're very happy,"" PETA assistant director Dan Shannon said. ""Michael Vick can afford the best lawyers, and he's got a lot going for him, and he got two years. . . . ""This sends a powerful message that dogfighting is going to be taken seriously."" John Goodwin of the HumaneSociety agreed, saying the case already has had a ripple effect across the country, with 25 states considering adopting stricter laws and penalties for dogfighting. ""It's put a spotlight on a very brutal and cruel activity, and that spotlight is generating more prosecutions and greater numbers of arrests,"" he said. Just before Vick's sentencing hearing began, a charter bus arrived with supporters from the Psalms Ministry in Hampton, whose members said Vick is a congregant. They took their place across Main Street next to the PETA protesters and sang gospel hymns in support of Vick. ""We Love U, Ookie,"" stated some signs invoking Vick's nickname. Others wore T-shirts stating: ""Michael loves Christ. Christ loves Michael. How about you?"" Shawn Dotson still loves Vick. The chef from Lynchburg, who camped in line in August to see Vick's plea hearing, showed up again yesterday morning to see his idol get sentenced. ""It was stiff,"" a disappointed Dotson said. ""It shouldn't have been that way."" For other spectators, yesterday's hearing was a field trip. Teacher Katrina Thorne escorted 19 of her students from Rocky Mount High School in North Carolina to an overflow courtroom to watch the sentence as part of her business-law class. ""This is historical,"" she said, standing outside a ring of reporters behind the courthouse after the sentencing, waiting for Vick's attorney to make a statement. ""A learning experience for us all.""

140093,1115 words,The Washington Post,METRO; Pg. B06,Digging deeper into a war's legacy,2011,"Janet Bohlen inspects a faded 1918 photo of a dozen Army soldiers standing shoulder-deep in rugged trenches. The uniformed men aim their rifles at an unseen target behind American University. ""It looks like they're right on the playing field, doesn't it?"" she says, sitting in her living room. ""Wouldn't you love to be able to identify exactly where that is now?"" From the other side of her coffee table, her husband, Buff, quips, ""Don't you recognize your own back yard?"" The Bohlens have lived in the Spring Valley section of Northwest Washington for 52 years, raising three children and now settling into retirement. Over the past two decades, the Army Corps of Engineers has excavated pockets of their wealthy, tree-lined neighborhood, which was built over the Army's World War I chemical warfare testing grounds, to analyze possible contamination. Now, Johns Hopkins University is about to embark on yet another health study in this neighborhood. The Bohlens are typical of families there who still wonder whether certain cancers and other serious health problems have been caused by the presence of buried toxic chemicals. The new study, funded by the D.C. Health Department at the behest of D.C. Council member Mary M. Cheh (D-Ward 3), isn't designed to address individual health issues. Instead, it will incorporate the corps' most recent soil and water sampling measurements in an attempt to provide an updated community health portrait. A 2007 Hopkins study found a lower-than-average occurrence of cancer in the neighborhood. But compared with the demographically similar Chevy Chase community, Spring Valley had more cases of arsenic-related conditions that affect the kidney, lungs, skin and bladder. Citing a general lack of understanding about the long-term effects of chemical weapons exposure, the report suggested conducting another study later. ""What we want to do is follow up on the health outcomes that were raised in the [2007] scoping study, in addition to the arsenic-related cancers that we looked at last time,""  Hopkins researcher Mary Fox said. In the early 2000s, the Army Corps found the vestiges of a shed once filled with detonators under a 70-year-old tree in the Bohlens' back yard, where Janet Bohlen said her daughter and neighborhood children would often play. Her daughter had severe mercury poisoning years before the discoveries, but Janet said there is no way for her family to know whether the Army artifacts and that condition were related. Janet has been treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a condition the 2007 study recognized as potentially arsenic-related. ""My cancer, as I say, is only one of many kinds of cancer, so you can't really equate it with anything going on in that particular environmental issue,"" she said. Fox said the study won't draw conclusions about the causes behind Spring Valley residents' health issues. Residents will be able to fill out surveys about their health, but they will not be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. ""It's a community health study, as opposed to an individual health study,"" Fox said. A 'domino effect' of illness Tall but fragile, Geza Teleki moves slowly around his Bethesda home, where he moved a few years ago with his wife, Heather, after raising their children in Spring Valley. Before he retired, Teleki was a conservationist, once serving as director of national parks in Sierra Leone. He was in ""excellent health,"" he said, before he left Africa in the 1990s and returned to Spring Valley. Teleki then worked from his basement office as a lobbyist for the WorldWildlifeFund. Teleki, 67, said he has no idea how many pills he takes in a week. His laundry list of health issues includes hypertension, kidney failure and diabetes. He was in his early 60s when the problems unexpectedly started. ""I was not overweight, I didn't eat junk food. I didn't do any of the things that Americans usually do to make themselves ill,"" he said. ""This kind of just fell out of the sky."" Teleki is convinced that toxins left over from the military's use of the area caused his health issues. ""The first thing that happened was kidney failure. And then came the diabetes, instead of in the reverse order. And then came a whole series of other things. So it was a progression, like a domino effect, of things going wrong,"" Teleki said. His feet turned black, to the confusion of his doctors. No on could understand what it was, he said. ""As it turned out, the soldiers in World War I who had arsenic gas contamination - their feet turned black."" His son Aidan spent many hours raising pet rats in their basement when he was a child. Aidan, now 16, is taking medication for thyroid problems, Teleki said. ""The thyroid is one of the most responsive organs to toxic contamination, so it's usually the first to go. And now we have to worry, for years to come,"" he said. Teleki may have good reason to worry. The Army Corps had tested the soil around his Spring Valley house and given his residence a clean bill of health in 2003, but Teleki repeatedly questioned the assessment. He said he discovered a report by the corps that found more than 20 toxins and heavy metals on his property. The corps responded through a spokesman that ""there was no significant risk to Teleki's home."" Teleki's was one of more than 100 homes that ultimately had their soil cleaned up, said corps project manager Dan Noble. But, Clem Gaines, the spokesman, said, ""We should have done a better job of communicating with him."" Skepticism of study  Teleki is skeptical about Johns Hopkins's efforts. ""I don't think there's any point in doing the Johns Hopkins study unless it has a major component of tracking down people around the country,"" he said. ""If it does, you'll have a much more accurate picture of the families who were affected."" Johns Hopkins will not track down former Spring Valley residents, but they can fill out the online version of the health survey that will be mailed to residents, Fox said. At a routine public meeting of local government representatives, Johns Hopkins researchers, residents and the corps in September, Spring Valley resident Lee Monsein echoed Teleki's skepticism. ""Are you going to prove that arsenic caused these cancers, or disease, or hypertension? It's not going to happen,"" he said. ""I want closure."" Beth Resnick, outreach coordinator for the Hopkins study, said that despite residents' concerns, they'll never be able to prove whether the buried chemicals are causing residents' health problems. ""It's really not possible. There are so many factors that would go into it, and so much money and time involved,"" she said. ""What we want to do is inform them of their community health status, overall."" carignans@washpost.com","['work', 'telek', 'said', 'has', 'tak', 'includ', 'diabet', 'was', 'start']",51,9,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,['said'],1,1

122667,530 words,Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News,STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS,Newsmaker Q-and-A with Bill Deeley of Punxsutawney Groundhog Club,2010,"Feb. 1--Trying to reach Bill Deeley this time of year is a little like trying to call Santa Claus in December. Deeley, 60, president of the Inner Circle of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club, is busy getting Punxsutawney Phil ready for Tuesday. That's when more than 20,000 people are expected to descend on the small borough about 150 miles southeast of Erie to see if there will be six more weeks of winter. Deeley is the man who will read the groundhog's prediction. ""It's been a good, old-fashioned winter so far, and I know that people are eagerly looking forward to spring,"" said Deeley, a funeral home owner and lifelong Punxsutawney resident. Deeley took a few minutes to talk about his borough's big holiday. 1) How many people are you expecting for Groundhog's Day? I think the numbers will be down a little, maybe 22,000 to 23,000 people. We will miss a few because of the economy. It's had an impact on everything. But we'll still fill every motel in the tri-county area and have people crash at the community center. 2) When did this become such a big event? How much do you attribute to the Bill Murray movie ""Groundhog Day""? This event went from a quaint little ceremony to 30,000-plus people over the past 15 years or so. I think it was a combination of the movie and just more people talking about it. It was like a mini-Woodstock with bigger and bigger crowds that we couldn't accommodate. We made some changes about six years ago that have really worked out well. There is no alcohol allowed on the Knob, where the ceremony is held. That change has really made it a family-friendly atmosphere. We don't have to put up with all the drunks. It's not a place for them. 3) You were in the news last week when the PeoplefortheEthicalTreatmentofAnimals called for organizers to replace Phil with a robot. What is your reaction? I agree with PETA and what they stand for on most issues, but you have to see what we do with Phil. Like I have said, he's treated better than the average child in Pennsylvania. He lives in an air-conditioned home in the summer and a heated building at the zoo in the winter. He has running water, someone who feeds him, and he even gets an annual physical. I don't think it was fair for PETA to do what they did to us. 4) Why do people pay so much attention to a groundhog's weather forecast? This is the halfway point of winter, and people are just looking for a good time. I got in my car (Friday) morning, and my thermometer read minus-4. It's been a good, old-fashioned winter, and people are hoping that spring is getting close. 5) So, what is Phil's prediction? Will there be six more weeks of winter? It's cold here in Punxsutawney, so I would love to see spring. But I have no idea until I look into Phil's eyes. Then I'll make the call.

""The program will begin in Schuylkill County and we'll look at abandoned mine drainage sites and the legacy of coal mining,"" Sierra Gladfelter, New Ringgold, outreach and education coordinator for Schuylkill Headwaters Association, said Friday. From there, the seven-day field trip -- to begin June 7 and end June 14 -- will continue though Berks, Chester, Montgomery and Philadelphia counties, Gladfelter said. While Schuylkill Headwaters is developing applications, it's also continuing to raise funds for the estimated $15,000 program. Gladfelter said she will receive $5,000 for developing the project and the cost per high school student is $1,000. Toyota TogetherGreen is a project developed by Toyota and the NationalAudubonSociety. It has a website at togethergreen.org. Gladfelter said she received official notification of the $10,000 award Wednesday. The week-long project will be called Schuylkill Acts and Impacts: An Expedition to Inspire Watershed Action. ""Schuylkill Acts and Impacts will be a week-long summer program offered to a team of 10 high school students from diverse communities within the Schuylkill River Watershed. It will be from June 7 to 14. Seven full days. This project is kind of stepping beyond our work. We're going to take 10 students, two students from each of the five counties in the Schuylkill Watershed. So there will be two from Schuylkill County,"" she said. Students interested in applying can contact her at outreach@schuylkillheadwaters.org ""My goal is to make it competitive. I want students who want to be there. The application will challenge them to write a series of short answer essays about their interest working as a team and doing service work and if they know about conservation issues in their communities,"" she said. The program will involve a walk along the 120-mile Schuylkill River from its headwaters in the anthracite coal lands of Schuylkill County to its confluence with the Delaware River in Philadelphia. ""Team leaders and professionals will guide students down river, illustrating the array of issues affecting water quality and river ecology. Students will paddle stretches of the river with biologists and conduct basic water quality monitoring, tour abandoned and active coal mines, visit farms to examine stream bank erosion and walk Philadelphia's streets to witness pioneering work in mitigating stormwater. Each stop will involve a half-day service project,"" Gladfelter said. But students will also be studying and taking notes while on the journey. ""Daily writing assignments will ensure students reflect on watershed issues they encounter and make connections to their own habits and water usage. Introducing the next generation of potential environmental leaders to issues facing the river, this program will challenge participants to take action in their own stretch of the watershed,"" she said. She's hoping Schuylkill Acts and Impacts will become an annual event. ""If the pilot is successful, it will become an annual program administered jointly by the Schuylkill Headwaters Association and members of the Schuylkill Action Network to build youth capacity in environmental activism,"" she said. ___ (c)2013 the Republican & Herald (Pottsville, Pa.)

Some of the items in Senate Bill 444 would expand access - including an amendment by Sen. Lloyd Smucker, R-West Lampeter Township, regarding Pennsylvania's state-related universities. It would require Penn State, Temple, Pittsburgh and Lincoln universities to put information about their budgets, spending and revenue online in searchable, downloadable databases. The bill includes other positive changes, making appeals easier and demanding that records seen by a quorum of officials at a public meeting are made available to the public as well. Unfortunately, the backward steps Senate Bill 444 would take are significant. It calls for limiting public access to records of communications between government contractors and the agencies that hire them. This is worrisome, especially given the trend toward privatizing the state's bridge and road repairs. Those projects cost a lot of money, and the Senate bill's change to the Right-to-Know law could essentially contract away the public's right to know. The Senate bill also would expand an exemption that governments and agenices already overuse. The exemption of records related to ""internal, predecisional deliberations"" is meant to give agencies the ability to frankly discuss policies and decisions before making the range of considered options public. Expanding this exemption in any way can only harm the public's right to know. The simple fix would be to redact legitimately ""predecisional"" matters, rather than - as the Senate bill would allow - denying records completely. As citizens in East Earl Township and other municipalities have learned in recent months, it is critical that government be transparent. Pennsylvanians' right to government documents should be expanded, not diminished. The House should either strip the restrictive items out of the Senate bill or wait until next session and do it right.","['launch', 'cal', 'pennsylvan', 'us', 'monit', 'expand', 'includ', 'rwest', 'regard', 'staterel', 'requir', 'put', 'spend', 'databas', 'includ', 'mak', 'demand', 'seen', 'ar', 'mad']",113,20,"['cal', 'demand']",2,[],0,[],0,[],0,['monit'],1,[],0,[],0,['demand'],1,4
166901,1245 words,The New York Times,Section C; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 3,"A Genetically Modified Potato, Not for Eating, Is Stirring Some Opposition in Europe",2007,"Fight over oilsands will shake Canada; Former Alberta premier's warning foreshadows coming constitutional fracas  Peter Lougheed is dead right -- there's a battle looming over the explosive growth of Alberta's oilsands and it threatens Canada's national unity. The former Alberta premier, usually reticent to speak out on public policy matters, made national headlines last week with his comments about the runaway development in Alberta's north. He warned that the province's insistence on breakneck development of the oil-rich tarsands could trigger ""a major constitutional crisis."" On one side is the Canadian public, deeply worried about climate change, putting pressure on the federal government for strong environmental protection legislation that will lead to reduced greenhouse-gas emissions. On the other is Alberta, which has constitutional power over its non-renewable resources. The oilsands are Canada's fastest-growing source of greenhouse-gas emissions. In the last month, more than $50 billion worth of new developments have been announced and output is expected to double within the next few years. Now they are the target of environmental groups. Earlier this month Greenpeace set up an office in Edmonton, with the stated goal of halting ""the most destructive megaproject in the world."" And the pro-environment Pembina Institute has boosted its public-relations efforts in an attempt to warn Canadians of the oilsands' negative fallout. (If you doubt environmentalists' clout, look at the impact Greenpeace had on B.C.'s forest industry.) Even Lougheed -- a pro-Alberta campaigner if ever there was one -- says he was ""appalled"" after a helicopter flyover of the area last year. Contrast that concern with the attitude of current Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach, who warned other provinces at last week's premiers' conference not to ""mess with Alberta"" over greenhouse-gas emissions. If the federal government tries to assert itself through the Departments of Environment and force Alberta to slow the rate of oilsands' expansion, it risks alienating the country's most vibrant economic engine and inflaming the province's nascent separatist movement. Yet by doing nothing, Ottawa will face growing protest from the rest of the country for allowing Alberta to bleed carbon dioxide at a heedless rate. Albertans remember all too well the National Energy Program, blaming the policy for triggering a decade-long recession in the 1980s. They don't take kindly to the idea of another federal intervention into natural resources. Yet if the province won't act, it's becoming clear the federal government will be backed into a corner and forced to take action -- which can either end up in the Supreme Court, in growing Alberta separatism, or both. And Canadians have clearly stated their concern about greenhouse-gas emissions. The logical approach is for Alberta to rein in oilsands development: The resource isn't going anywhere, and will likely only grow more valuable in future years. Getting the province to see that light, however, is another matter. And the fallout from that insistence on growth at all costs will likely shake the country to its roots.  Copyright 2007 Times Colonist, a division of Canwest MediaWorks Publication Inc.  When Timo Bohme, a plant scientist, pulls up the cluster of dirt-encrusted potatoes from a tidy field here, he cradles them like a precious baby. For his employer, the German chemical giant BASF, these unassuming golden orbs, called Amflora potatoes, are the culmination of nearly 20 years of research and hold the promise of immense future profits. But not just yet. Amflora potatoes, likely to become the first genetically modified crop in the last decade to be approved for growth in Europe, have become the unlikely lightning rod in the angry debate over such products on the Continent. The European Commission now says it will approve the potato ''probably this fall,'' even though European ministers have twice been deadlocked on approval over the last eight months, with only a minority voting in favor. According to European Union procedures, ''the ministers have not been able to take a decision, so we will have to reaffirm our earlier opinion to recommend it,'' said Barbara Helferrich, spokeswoman for the European Commission's Environment Directorate. But European environmental groups are critical of Amflora potatoes, saying they could release dangerous genes into the environment. Approving Amflora would make ''a mockery of E.U. law,'' said Marco Contiero, an expert on genetically modified organisms at Greenpeace in Brussels. Still, perhaps the biggest hurdle for Amflora is the visceral popular reaction against genetically modified crops on a continent whose food culture is ancient and treasured. ''I just don't like the idea,'' said Monika Stahl, 31, waiting for a bus with a sack of fresh vegetables in Mannheim, just 12 miles from the Amflora field. ''I worry about safe food and about the environment. I have children and worry about them.'' In one sense, the irony is that Amflora is not a food at all. Although it looks, feels and smells like any other  potato, each one is actually a genetically engineered factory for amylopectin, a starch used to make glossy paper coatings, clothing finishes and adhesive cement. Normal potatoes combine amylopectin and amylose; the gene for amylose is turned off in Amflora potatoes, which taste terrible, and will never be turned into French fries or a potato salad. ''You would think that this approval would have been easy since this potato has no seeds, no wild relatives to cross with in Europe, and only industrial use,'' said Ralf-Michael Schmidt, vice president of BASF. ''But it didn't turn out that way.'' Only 1 percent of the world's genetically modified food is grown in Europe. In contrast, 55 percent of the world's acreage in genetically modified crops is in the United States. From 1998 to 2004, the European Union had a moratorium on the approval of new genetically modified crops and food, so experts could study the risks involved. Under pressure from the World Trade Organization and the United States, that was lifted. The European Commission has been under enormous pressure to open its doors to crops like this ever since a W.T.O. decision in 2006 that made banning genetically modified crops tantamount to an illegal trade barrier. But if the approval process for industrial Amflora has proved a challenge  -- BASF first filed an application to grow the potatoes in 1994  --  the road will certainly be far more arduous for other planned genetically modified crops because they do involve plants intended for food or animal feed. ''That will be a much tougher sell,'' Ms. Helferrich said. Indeed, BASF has a second application for Amflora pending that would allow the potato residue after starch extraction to be used as animal feed. Even Germany, which has favored the approval of Amflora for industrial use, would not support that application, said Wolfgang Kohler, head of the unit for gene technology at the German Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection. He said: ''I'm very doubtful we could vote in favor for food and feed because of fears about transmission'' of genes into the environment or food supply. He noted that more than 70 percent of Germans say they do not want genetically modified organisms, or G.M.O.'s, in their food and the German food industry ''does everything it can to avoid using this stuff.'' Polls by the European Commission have shown that 80 percent to 90 percent of Europeans distrust genetically modified plants. ''We can authorize as many crops as we want, but the bigger problem is to convince people they are safe,'' Ms. Helferrich said. In the United States, where genetically modified crops have been grown widely for more than a decade, approvals are left to expert agencies. But in the European Union  --  where voters and politicians are more passionate about food --  such approvals involve a more democratic process. On a crop-by-crop basis, the scientific recommendations of the European Food Safety Agency are voted on by ministers from the 27 member states. Approvals bounce back and forth and ultimately arrive at the European Commission in Brussels when member states cannot agree. ''As a scientist I have a hard time understanding it, but this is how Europe has chosen to make these decisions,'' said Susanne Benner, communications director at BASF. ''But it's hard when you see an innovative product go through the loops again and again. These decisions are not about science but about politics.'' In February 2006, a scientific review by the European Food Safety Agency concluded that planting Amflora to make starch posed no more risk than planting an ordinary potato. Based on that opinion, Europe's administrative governing body, the European Commission, recommended approval and passed the application to the Council of Ministers, where it has been voted on twice, first by a council of experts from member states in December and again on Monday by European agriculture ministers. Approval requires a 74 percent majority. But the two votes were inconclusive, with a huge number of countries abstaining on a decision that is a political minefield. The voting is anonymous, but some information leaked out: In the second vote, the agriculture ministers of Italy, Ireland and Austria voted no; Germany and Belgium said yes; and France and Bulgaria abstained. ''These are elected politicians and they have to face the general unease at home about G.M.O.'s,'' said a European Union official who asked not to be identified because of the delicacy of the issue. ''They are passing the buck to the commission, which is between a rock and a hard place on this issue.'' Many experts and even some of Europe's environment ministers continue to dispute the European food agency's scientific opinion that Amflora is safe for cultivation. One concern is that it contains a gene for antibiotic resistance that could get out of the potato and into the environment, making bacteria that infect man and beast more difficult to treat. The European Food Safety Agency concluded that this was unlikely given the closed system in which potato-based starch is produced. But a second dossier from BASF  --  one that received a positive review from the food safety agency, but has not yet come to a ministers' vote  --  involves using leftover Amflora pulp from starch production for animal feed. ''It is a fact that there will be contamination, given the volume of the industry,'' said Mr. Contiero of Greenpeace. ''And if animals are eating pulp it certainly will end up in food. This is not just an opinion.''","['set', 'halt', 'has', 'boost', 'warn', 'doubt', 'clout', 'look', 'had', 'loughee', 'was', 'say', 'was', 'appal', 'warn', 'mess', 'said', 'mod', 'is', 'mod', 'is', 'treas', 'said', 'wait', 'worry', 'is', 'be', 'giv', 'said', 'ar', 'eat', 'end', 'is']",231,33,"['warn', 'warn']",2,['halt'],1,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,"['mod', 'mod']",2,"['warn', 'say', 'warn', 'said', 'said', 'said']",6,11

46249,1873 words,The Washington Post,A SECTION; Pg. A04,Opponents Draw Line in Sand at Proposed Nuclear Dump Site,1996,"William Claiborne, Washington Post Staff Writer  A desolate, 1,000-acre tract of federal land in the Mojave Desert has become Ground Zero for an explosive political battle over how to dispose of the millions of cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste that the United States produces each year. Just 19 miles west of the Colorado River, a consortium of four western states led by California is proposing to bury beneath the desert the detritus of the atomic age: vast quantities of low-level nuclear waste that is now backing up at nuclear power plants, research laboratories, hospitals and biotech industry factories. But critics warn that after the waste is buried in shallow, unlined trenches, it is certain to seep 650 feet through the sandy soil to the underground water table and eventually contaminate the Colorado River, a major source of water for 15 million residents of Southern California. The debate has generated intense emotions in this remote town of 5,600 people. An illegal encampment of militant environmentalists has been underway since October at the proposed dump site in Ward Valley. Civil disobedience campaigns aimed at protecting the fragile desert ecology of the Mojave, including the endangered desert tortoise, are being threatened. ""It has to stop somewhere, and this is where we're going to make our stand,"" declared Greenpeace activist Michael Matthews, one of the protesters camping out at the dump site. But beyond the protest rhetoric and guerrilla theater, including a Native American spiritual gathering to preserve the land as it is and the flying of an upside-down American flag as a distress symbol, loom much larger issues that have made it impossible for any state so far to find a long-term solution for dealing with nuclear waste. No community wants a dump in its midst and there is still strong debate among scientists over the best way to dispose of low-level waste that in some cases will be hazardous for hundreds -- or even thousands -- of years. So controversial has the issue become that legislation adopted by Congress 16 years ago to create regional disposal sites has so far been impossible to implement. The dump in the Mojave Desert would be the first state-run repository in the nation under the federal plan, and proponents say many states are waiting to see how California fares before moving ahead with their own plans. Its failure could stop all future efforts elsewhere, they say. The federal 1980 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act made regional state ""compacts"" responsible only for disposing of low-level radioactive waste produced by industries and medical and research institutions. The federal government produces twice as much waste as the commercial sector and is already storing it at six sites in Nevada, Washington state, South Carolina, Tennessee, Idaho and New Mexico. Although the struggle over the planned dump here has focused largely on typically contentious environmental and social issues like water quality, the habitat of the endangered desert tortoise and American Indian rights, the real conflict boils down to whether low-level industrial radioactive waste should be stored cheaply in 40-foot-deep unlined trenches, or in more costly above-ground reinforced bunkers that are continuously monitored for leaks and which can be easily repaired when necessary. Opponents of the Ward Valley burial have suggested the use instead of the decommissioned Rancho Seco nuclear power plant near Sacramento, which already has steel and concrete bunkers and monitoring equipment. The argument has taken on added significance because the federal budget reconciliation bill in Congress remains gridlocked partly over an amendment sought by nuclear industry lobbyists that would transfer the federally owned desert land to California and allow the dump to go forward. A legislative solution, as opposed to an administrative land transfer, would block environmentalist efforts to tie things up in lengthy court battles. Congressional Republicans appear determined to keep the land transfer tied to the budget bill, and President Clinton appears just as determined to veto it because, he has said, it would effectively waive all applicable environmental laws at Ward Valley. Opponents of the project say that contamination here would be repeated at the 12 regional state-run disposal facilities envisioned in the 1980 federal act because of an ""out of sight, out of mind"" mentality that they say is inherent in shallow-trench nuclear waste burial. Some of the environmentalists make no attempt to hide a more ambitious agenda aimed at a phased reduction of all industrial and military nuclear activity, including the shutdown of nuclear power plants; others concede the need for producing large quantities of nuclear materials and question only the method of waste disposal. Industry spokesmen, led by U.S. Ecology Inc., which was given the license to manage the dump, say that most of the material destined for Ward Valley will be relatively benign medical and research waste, such as contaminated gloves, clothing, laboratory equipment and isotopes used in making drugs. Less than half of the waste, they say, will be irradiated components from nuclear reactors and none of it, by federal law, will include spent nuclear fuel rods or spent nuclear weapons waste. Opponents contend that most of the waste will be from nuclear power plants. ""In any case, that debate is academic. Federal law requires the disposal of radioactive waste, and the law doesn't concern itself with the source of the waste. The thing that matters is the level of radioactivity,"" said Alan Pasternak, technical director of the California Radioactive Materials Management Forum, which represents the generators of low-level radioactive waste. However, Philip M. Klasky, co-director of the San Francisco-based Bay Area Nuclear Waste Coalition, said the term ""low-level radiation"" is misleading because in the United States, waste classifications are defined by process and not by toxicity and longevity. Many ""low-level"" wastes contain the same radioactive elements contained in the ""high-level"" waste stream. For example, he said, cesium and strontium, which remain toxic for up to 300 years, are called ""high-level"" wastes when in a reactor core. But once sifted through filters, they are reclassified as ""low-level"" waste, even though their toxicity is extremely long-lasting. ""It is a disingenuous mask to say that they will be dumping hospital gloves and booties out there. This stuff lasts a long time -- hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of years. It is environmentally irresponsible to bury it like this and stick the public with millions of dollars in cleanup costs sometime in the future,"" Klasky said. Environmentalists are also attacking the manner in which the federal government tentatively approved Ward Valley as the dump site for waste from California, Arizona and the Dakotas. They charge that geological data were manipulated to make the site appear to pose no risk to the Colorado River. Last May, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt conditionally agreed to transfer the site to the state for the dump after a National Academy of Sciences committee concluded that it was ""highly unlikely"" the river would be polluted as long as deposits of highly toxic plutonium 239 were limited. Babbitt ordered the academy review after three scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey warned in a June 2, 1993, memorandum that nuclear waste buried at Ward Valley could leach into ground water and pollute the Colorado River and complained of inadequate monitoring plans. The three scientists, meeting what they said was resistance at Interior, gave a copy of their report to Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), who accused Babbitt of a coverup. It was then that the secretary ordered the Academy of Sciences review. Boxer, in a telephone interview, said she opposed the dump because ""You're playing here with the health and safety of people, and you have to sit back and think about the consequences of what you do."" One of the U.S. Geological Survey scientists, Howard Wilshire, charged that he and his two whistleblower colleagues were ""blackballed"" by the agency because of their memo. He subsequently lost his job in a downsizing by the Geological Survey last October. Wilshire said another Geological Survey test not seen by the Academy of Sciences showed high levels of radioactive pollutants in ground water underneath a nuclear dump near Beatty, Nev., that U.S. Ecology Inc. operated until it was ordered shut down in 1993. The Beatty dump had been closed several times by regulators for numerous violations, including a 1976 incident in which U.S. Ecology employees were found selling radioactive tools to local residents. Babbitt has ordered a review of the Beatty tests to see whether a new examination of Ward Valley should be done. Daniel Hirsch, president of the Committee to Bridge the Gap, a Los Angeles-based group of nuclear academics opposed to the dump, said he is skeptical that anything will come of the review. An Interior Department spokeswoman, Stephanie Hanna, said that there was no coverup and that the Academy of Sciences committee saw at least some of the Beatty test data. She said the committee felt it was not relevant to Ward Valley because of ""differences in the types of waste and the way it was stored."" Hanna also said that Wilshire's memo was made available to the panel but stressed that the Survey hydrologist made his recommendations ""as an individual, with no peer review."" The Beatty dump is not the only one managed by U.S. Ecology Inc. that has had leakage problems. Its dump in Maxey Flats, Ky., for example, was put on the Environmental Protection Agency's Superfund list of most-polluted sites in 1986 after plutonium and other radioactive wastes were discovered leaking. In 1988 the company agreed to pay $ 8 million for cleanup after radioactive waste polluted a lake near a dump in Sheffield, Ill. Richard Paton, vice president of government affairs of U.S. Ecology's parent company, American Ecology Corp., said: ""A lot has changed since Maxey Flats and Sheffield. There wasn't a whole lot of guidance and federal rules and regulations then. Now, for example, you can't take liquid waste like we used to, and the containers we use are consistent with the hazardous lifespan of the materials."" Paton denied that any appreciable amounts of radioactivity would leach into ground water under the Ward Valley site or into the Colorado River and accused opponents of generating hysteria. ""We fully expect the site will become operational. Any time you are dealing with a land use that is traditionally viewed as not typical, you get opposition,"" Paton said. The CalRad Forum's Pasternak said that resistance to the Ward Valley project is based less on scientific evidence than on ideological opposition to all nuclear activity, as well as political opposition by those who simply want the waste deposited somewhere else. ""My guess is that if we planned monitored, above-ground facilities, they'd demand that we bury the stuff,"" he said. ""Because the real reason for their opposition is ideological, not environmental.""

153835,626 words,Idaho Falls Post Register (Idaho),THE WEST; Pg. B1,In the crosshairs; Sheep station's impact under scrutiny,2010,"After operating for much of its 93-year history in relative seclusion, the U.S. Sheep Experiment Station in Dubois suddenly finds itself at the forefront of the West's land-use battle. Station representatives recently announced that, due to concerns over grizzly bear habitat, it will not turn out sheep this year on one of its grazing plots in the Centennial Mountains on the Idaho-Montana border. Grazing on the East Summer plot wouldn't directly impact grizzly habitat, but to reach it, sheep would have to cross U.S. Forest Service land that has been designated a sensitive habitat area for grizzlies, which were recently relisted as an endangered species. """"Our allotment has not been shut down. We just can't get there,"""" said Sandy Miller Hays, a spokeswoman for the division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the sheep station's operations. Hays said the station will continue to graze its stock on another plot in the Centennials. To reach that plot, sheep will cross land also owned by the Forest Service, she said, but that land is not considered a sensitive grizzly habitat area. Some conservationists say the station hasn't gone far enough to protect wild species in its area of operation.  Katie Strong of the GreaterYellowstoneCoalition said the station should shut down all of its grazing plots in the Centennial Mountains, which she described as a dispersal corridor for population pockets of grizzlies, wolves, wolverines and bighorn sheep. """"We're OK with (the sheep station) staying in existence as long as they stop grazing in the Centennial Mountains,"""" Strong said. Crossing paths with the likes of bears and wolves may seem like trouble only for the sheep, but Strong said that's just the problem. Word that predators have killed domestic sheep and other prey tends to put the predators in a bad light, leading to pressure on government agencies to take steps against them, she said. """"You shouldn't be researching in areas where sheep are vulnerable to predators,"""" Strong said. Conservationists are also concerned that the station's sheep will come in contact with bighorn sheep moving through the area. In recent years, bighorn sheep populations in the West have suffered from a type of pneumonia some believe is spread through contact with domestic sheep. But Hays said contact between bighorns and the station's sheep is rare. Contrary to Strong's belief, she said, few bighorns have been spotted moving through the Centennial Mountains near the station's grazing plots. """"There really isn't the kind of contact between our sheep and the wild species that everybody seems to think,"""" Hays said. More bighorns have been seen in the station's grazing areas southwest of Dubois, Hays said. To make sure domestic sheep steer clear of them, she said, the station surrounds the flock with lookouts who scan the area for bighorns. If a scout sees a bighorn, the flock is immediately removed from the area, Hays said. """"The bottom line is we don't want to be out there too close to the bighorns,"""" she said. Herb Meyr, director of the group Bighorn Sheep Society of Idaho, said he has been satisfied, so far, with the station's efforts to minimize contact between its stock and bighorn sheep. He said the station has avoided overgrazing its animals and keeps them moving to minimize their impact on habitat. By the numbers 27,930: acres in the sheep station's Clark County headquarters. 16,600: acres of grazing land in Montana. 3,800: acres of grazing land in Idaho. 3,000: mature sheep in the station's operation. 6,500: approximate total of sheep after lambing period. 920: human residents of Clark County. 21: permanent, full-time workers employed by the station.

Previously, pine trees in North America have been cited as the oldest, at 4,000 to 5,000 years old. In the Swedish mountains, scientists have found a cluster of 20 spruces that are more than 8,000 years old. For many years, the spruce tree has been regarded as a relative newcomer in the Swedish mountain region, but the results of scientists from Umea University proved the opposite. The spruce trees in the area survived harsh weather conditions by pushing out another trunk as the other one died. The 9,550-year-old Swedish tree was carbon-14 dated at a lab in Miami.

Instead, the population could be the last survivors of the Javan elephant race, saved from extinction by the Sultan of Sulu centuries ago. An article by the WorldWildlifeFund supports the long-held local belief that the elephants were brought to Borneo by the sultan and later abandoned in the jungle. The origins of pygmy elephants, found only on the northeast tip of the island, have long been shrouded in mystery. Their looks and behavior differ from other Asian elephants, and scientists have questioned why they never dispersed to other parts of the island.

46231,959 words,The Washington Post,A SECTION; Pg. A07,Tuna Fishing Bill Divides Environmental Activists,1996,"Gary Lee, Washington Post Staff Writer  A controversial method of tuna fishing has pitted an unlikely coalition of White House officials, Greenpeace activists and GOP lawmakers against a group of Democratic lawmakers and marine science specialists in one of the most divisive environmental battles of the Clinton administration. In the method, known as purse seining, fishermen encircle a school of tuna -- and the dolphins that often swim with them -- with a net stretching as far as a mile across the sea. Gradually the circular net is drawn together to capture the bounty. Vice President Gore and other senior administration officials are leading a campaign for passage of a new statute that would sanction purse seining as an environmentally friendly method of tuna fishing in the Eastern Pacific Tropical Tuna Fishery, which stretches from Southern California to South America. The new law would reverse a six-year U.S. embargo against tuna caught by fishermen who use the method to capture schools of the fish, often accompanied by dolphins. The ban was imposed after environmentalists pointed to the technique as a major contributor to the dramatic decline of dolphin species that swam with tuna and were incidentally captured in the nets. The embargo has allowed only tuna caught using alternative methods involving no killing of dolphins to be labeled as ""dolphin safe."" Proponents of the bill argue that fishermen in Mexico, Venezuela and other countries that favor the encircling method have improved it to allow the majority of dolphins captured in the process to be taken alive and released. As evidence of the improvement, they cite a 90 percent drop in dolphin mortality in the Eastern Pacific Fishery since 1990. Currently, about 4,000 dolphins are killed in the fishery each year. Parallel Senate and House bills, introduced by Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska) and Rep. Wayne T. Gilchrest (R-Md.), would allow tuna caught by purse seining to be sold in the United States as ""dolphin safe."" Even tuna caught by techniques involving some dolphin deaths could be sold in U.S. stores, although it could not be labeled ""dolphin safe."" The proposals also call for monitoring of tuna fishing throughout the region. Proponents are pushing for House and Senate floor votes on the bills in the next few weeks. The legislation would codify the Panama Declaration, negotiated last year, in which the United States and 10 fishing nations agreed that the countries would move toward dolphin-safe fishing practices if their tuna was allowed into the U.S. market. ""In recent years, we have reduced dolphin mortality in the Pacific Tuna Fishery far below historic levels,"" Gore said in an endorsement of the proposals distributed to lawmakers last month. This new legislation ""will codify an international agreement to lock these gains in place."" But Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and a coalition of environmental groups, including the SierraClub, are leading a charge against the proposed statute. The critics argue the legislation will bring a return to the fishing practices that led to the slaughter of up to an estimated 7 million dolphins between the 1960s and late 1980s in the eastern Pacific. In an advertising campaign launched last month in several major newspapers, the opponents attacked the proposed legislation as ""the dolphin death act."" ""This legislation will only lead to a revival of the savage assault against dolphins that we fought hard to end,"" said Sam LaBudde, a marine biologist whose dramatic videotapes of the capture of dolphins during purse seining led to the boycott and eventual embargo on tuna caught by this process. Passage of the legislation is likely to prompt environmentalists to mount another nationwide boycott of tuna caught by purse seining, LaBudde warned. In spite of concerted attempts to mitigate the danger purse seining imposes on dolphins, the technology still kills some dolphins and injures others, according to LaBudde and other opponents of the legislation. And the process of herding the dolphins and tuna into the nets, which sometimes involves the use of helicopters and speedboats, traumatizes the dolphins to the point that their lives are shortened, according to Christopher Croft, a Washington-based environmental consultant and former observer on tuna fishing vessels. Opponents of the legislation favor two other forms of tuna fishing. One involves encircling logs or other objects in the water that attract tuna but attract far fewer dolphins than purse seining. The other involves encircling other kinds of fish and hauling them in with the tuna. Both methods are considered dolphin safe and are practiced widely by Starkist and other U.S. tuna companies. According to critics, however, the alternative forms of tuna fishing bring in large numbers of billfish, sharks, sea turtles and other forms of marine life. These marine animals are then thrown back dead into the sea, the critics say. They also charge that alternative methods deplete populations of younger tuna that congregate around logs and other floating objects. The alternative methods are ""contradictory to sound conservation policy,"" Greenpeace spokesman Clif Curtis said in an interview. ""Killing juvenile tuna, especially at a rate that jeopardizes the reproduction of the stocks, will impact the tuna population overall and drive the species down to dangerously low levels,"" he added. The fight over the legislation has led to unusual acrimony among environmental groups, with one coalition composed of Greenpeace, WorldWildlifeFund, the NationalWildlifeFederation and The EnvironmentalDefenseFund supporting the bill and the SierraClub and EarthIslandInstitute, a San Francisco-based organization, opposing it.","['has', 'pit', 'greenpeac', 'known', 'sein', 'encirc', 'swim', 'is', 'drawn', 'capt', 'ar', 'lead', 'sanct', 'sein', 'stretches', 'sou', 'includ', 'ar', 'lead', 'propos', 'argu', 'bring', 'led', 'estim', 'launch', 'attack', 'propos', 'lead', 'fought', 'end', 'said', 'sein', 'led', 'caught', 'ar', 'sound', 'said', 'kil', 'jeopard', 'impact', 'driv', 'ad', 'has', 'led', 'compos', 'support', 'earthislandinstitut', 'oppos']",357,48,['jeopard'],1,"['capt', 'attack', 'caught', 'kil', 'jeopard']",5,"['propos', 'propos']",2,['caught'],1,"['propos', 'propos']",2,[],0,['support'],1,"['argu', 'said', 'said', 'support', 'oppos']",5,17
110422,243 words,Morning Star,NA,Britain - Charity urged to go greener,2010,"Unite assistant general secretary Tony Burke called on the WorldWildlifeFund yesterday to promote a sustainable papermaking industry. Mr Burke said Unite was worried that the message from the charity is out of step with current thinking on British and European paper production, which he claimed is among the most progressive in the world when it comes to its green credentials. The charity urged computer users last week to adopt a green file format which prevents a document from being printed. But Mr Burke warned that this advice doesn't just put British paper and print industry jobs at risk, it is also out of step with latest practice within the industry in Europe and North America, where trees are harvested and replanted in sustainable forests. Mr Burke wrote to WorldWildlifeFund chief executive David Nussbaum to say that the danger of the charity's campaign is that it could well confuse the public. ""WWF statements regarding the effects of printing on paper are in our opinion misleading in that they could lead members of the public into believing that not using printed products or indeed printing out documents onto paper, would save trees and hence improve the environment,"" the letter said.

49862,813 words,Bangor Daily News (Maine),NA,LePage sees upside for global warming in Maine with opening of Northeast Passage,2013,"AUGUSTA, Maine -- Speaking to a conference assembled to discuss the transportation trends of the future, Gov. Paul LePage said Thursday that global climate change could have an upside for Maine.  ""Everybody looks at the negative effects of global warming, but with the ice melting, the Northern Passage has opened up,"" he said. ""So maybe, instead of being at the end of the pipeline, we're now at the beginning of a new pipeline.""  The Northeast Passage, also known as the northern sea route, is a maritime route through the Arctic Circle that connects the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, providing a shortcut from the U.S. East Coast to Asia -- and all the markets therein -- that shaves 40 percent off the distance of the traditional route through the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez Canal.  The recession of polar ice has opened up the Northeast Passage, over the past several years. In 2009, a German shipping vessel became the first commercial vessel to use the route, according to The New York Times. In 2011, 18 vessels used the route, the newspaper reported.  LePage touted the recently formed relationship between Maine and Icelandic shipping company Eimskip, which made Portland its North American headquarters earlier this year.  ""With Eimskip coming to Maine, with all the goods things happening -- it used to be global warming, I think they call it climate change now -- but there are a lot of opportunities developing,"" LePage said.  Icelandic President Olafur Grimsson, speaking in Portland this May, also cited the partnership between Eimskip and Portland, plus the opening of the Northeast Passage, as a potential boon for Maine and his country.  ""This could allow Portland to receive cargo from Europe, from Russia, the northern countries and in 10 years or so also from Asia and distribute it throughout the United States,"" Grimsson said.  The SierraClub of Maine and top state Democrats criticized the governor's comments.  ""Gov. LePage's statement that there is an upside to global climate disruption reflects an embarrassing ignorance of the alarming harmful environmental and economic ramifications of carbon pollution,"" said Glen Brand, the environmental group's director. ""Maine is already suffering from numerous problems from climate change, including threats to the state's fisheries, forests, coasts and tourist industries.""  U.S. Rep Mike Michaud, whose bid to unseat LePage in next year's gubernatorial election earned the SierraClub's endorsement, noted that just this week, regulators shut down Maine's shrimp fishery because stocks have collapsed, in part due to warming oceans. The state's clam industry is also in danger because of invasive European green crabs, which have flocked to Maine waters as temperatures rise.  ""Any potential benefit of allowing climate change to continue unaddressed is far outweighed by the danger of our failure to act,"" Michaud said.  Maine House Democratic Leader Seth Berry of Bowdoinham said that while any situation could have a silver lining, the governor didn't adequately recognize the gravity of the threat climate change poses on Maine.  Berry mentioned a bill LePage vetoed that would have created a climate change study, and his lack of support for renewable energy.  ""The bottom line is that climate change represents a major threat to our economy and our way of life here in Maine, and the governor needs to take that threat a whole lot more seriously,"" Berry said.  In the past, LePage has said he's not convinced that human activity is causing climate change. On renewable energy, he has said he doesn't want to pick winners and losers in the energy market, and that he supported renewables only if they were as affordable as traditional energy sources.  In November, he instructed his Department of Environmental Protection to convene a working group to summarize the work state agencies are already doing to address changing weather. That came five months after LePage vetoed the Legislature-approved climate change study Berry mentioned.  Brent Littlefield, senior political adviser on LePage's re-election campaign, said critics were taking the governor's comments out of context.  ""Certainly, the governor was not making a statement here about environmental policy,"" he said. The statements about Eimskip and the Northeast Passage are about jobs, he said.  Littlefield added that during LePage's administration, the state had handed out its largest penalty to an environmental polluter, when it fined the Chevron oil company $900,000 for spilling nearly 140,000 gallons of oil into the Penobscot River.  LePage has ""made it very clear that growing jobs does not have to compete with growing the environment, and that if people want to harm Maine's environment, and break the law, there will be penalties,"" Littlefield said.

Man on stabbing spree kills 3, injures 2 NEW YORK (AP) -- A man went on a deadly stabbing spree Friday, killing his stepfather, then his girlfriend and her mother before injuring two others as he escaped, police said. Police launched a manhunt for Maksim Gelman, 23, saying he had stabbed Aleksandr Kuznetsov, 54, numerous times at around 5 a.m. Police found the victim inside his Brooklyn home after receiving a 911 call. About 11 hours later, police received another 911 call reporting a stabbing a few blocks away. Police discovered the bodies of Gelman's girlfriend and her mother. Police said Gelman escaped in a Lexus he had stolen, drove a few blocks before carjacking and stabbing another driver, then hitting a pedestrian as he escaped. The pedestrian was hospitalized in critical condition. The driver was stable. Murder case closed after 40 years UTICA (AP) -- Authorities have closed a nearly 40-year-old murder case, saying the victim was likely slain by a man who died in prison after being convicted of two other killings. Oneida County District Attorney Scott McNamara said Friday that John W. Hopkins of Johnstown was probably the man who raped and stabbed Joanne Pecheone, 19, as she walked home from school in East Utica in January 1972. He was later convicted of murdering two other teens near his hometown in Fulton County in 1976 and 1978 and trying to kidnap another in 1979. McNamara said the conclusion that Hopkins was the killer came after a two-year investigation. Hopkins was 46 and serving a sentence of 58 years to life when he committed suicide in 2000. Patrol cars to feature vibrating sirens NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Police Department plans to equip all of its new police vehicles with a siren system called the Rumbler. The system emits woofer-driven sound waves that drivers and pedestrians can feel. The vibrations will be accompanied by a low whooping sound. Robert Martinez, the NYPD's director of fleet service, told the Wall Street Journal that about 500 cars will be equipped with the new system by summer. Eventually, 5,000 NYPD vehicles will have Rumblers. The agency buys about 1,300 new cars a year. Police began using the system in a pilot program in 2009.

47060,938 words,Contra Costa Times (California),LOCAL; News; Contra Costa; Growth; My Town,Critics brace for uphill ridgeline fight,2008,"PITTSBURG -- After more than two years of intense review and planning, a controversial guideline for building on the city's hills and ridges will go before the City Council. Leading up to the April 7 meeting, some residents, environmental groups and representatives from Concord have sought to convince Pittsburg leaders that the new standard could allow homes to climb up ridges where they could be seen from other communities. A draft proposal by the city's Planning Commission addresses questions on how many homes should be allowed at certain heights, at what height development should be allowed and where, if the area designated for development is deemed visually sensitive, and how the houses should be kept up and which areas of land should apply. The bulk of the proposed guideline deals with uphill development, establishing that three homes per acre be allowed with a minimum lot size of 10,000 square feet at elevations of 500 feet. It would put all the homes on one side of the street with an emphasis on minimal grading, according to a draft for Hillside Development Regulations. The regulations also set guidelines for grading, restricting development above 900 feet and on slopes greater than 30 percent. The plan also encourages the building of estate homes by removing a policy allowing for density bonuses for projects with cluster homes, thus preserving large portions of hillside development, city staff members said. Added language would restrict commercial uses in hillside development projects and encourage them along San Marco Boulevard. Proposed hillside standards would also prohibit development within 150 feet of a major ridge or in places where the homes would be ""silhouetted against the skyline as seen from any freeway, highway or major streets."" Representatives of Save Our Hills in Pittsburg, a group concerned about hillside development, contends that the ordinance needs to apply to areas below 500 feet and the proposed guideline fails to protect ridgelines. ""It's a very weak piece of legislation, it has a lot of loopholes and offers virtually no protection for important hills,"" said Dennis Linsley of the Save Our Hills group, adding that he hopes the areas' open spaces are protected and not turned into urban parks. Linsley and Christina Wong, speaking on behalf of Greenbelt Alliance, said the Planning Commission's changes have ""less teeth"" than originally proposed by city planners. ""I don't think it's fair for Pittsburg to say this ordinance is anything more than a blank check for the developer,"" Wong said. If the city is serious about protecting its hills, she said, leaders would put rules in place governing the area before an application is brought forward. Opponents, who include Save Mount Diablo, the SierraClub, and the Concord Naval Weapons Station Neighborhood Alliance, have said that the regulations do not provide clear limits on developers, specifically the Seeno family of development companies, which owns most of the land. Plans are in place to build as many as 1,938 homes on the Montreux, Faria and Thomas Ranch properties, if they are annexed into the city. Kiley Russell, a Seeno spokesman, said the company had no comment on the commission's recommendation. In the past year, Seeno officials told the commission the documents do not provide sensible, realistic and safe development guidelines. Throughout the planning commission process, Concord planners have expressed concerns about Pittsburg allowing developers to build too high and not consider whether the structures they build would be visible in Concord despite developers adhering to city rules. To quell city disputes, the Los Medanos Hills-Concord and Pittsburg Working Group has met sporadically in the past few years to address this issue. The group has worked on creating areas along the city borders where development would be restricted. Pittsburg councilmen Ben Johnson and Salvatore Evola sit on that committee. During a meeting Friday, Concord City Councilwoman Laura Hoffmeister said that all plans to develop the former Concord Naval Weapons Station include keeping the hills against the Pittsburg border undeveloped. She also questioned which ridgelines Pittsburg planners took into account in maps they showed the Planning Commission Following the meeting, Pittsburg's representatives said they would wait until the April 7 meeting to express their opinion. Johnson reiterated that what the council would look at is ""just a guideline"" for development and each project would go through a separate strict review process. Evola also said he didn't want to comment until the April 7 meeting. Evola was also not sure whether he would recuse himself from voting, saying that though he works as a senior vice president for Discovery Builders, the guidelines were all for growth on Pittsburg's hills. When asked by phone about the April 7 meeting, Pittsburg Councilman Michael Kee said he had kept current on the hillside plans to a certain degree, but didn't know ""enough to make an informed decision."" ""There has to be a balancing act that takes into account the developers' needs, but also provides protections for the hills,"" he said, adding that there's a ""sensitive nature"" to the issue.

I first met 51st Assembly District candidate Howard Marklein when he was out walking the streets in Shullsburg, campaigning for his initial run and detailing his goals if elected. He asked me what my concerns were in state government. He's a candidate who listened and discussed how to address issues on my personal agenda. He continued to listen to my opinions about issues and helped our city expand a few of its businesses. He was always there to answer emails and phone calls. I am usually dissatisfied with an elected official who forgets about the people who voted him into office or promises made to people during campaigns. When this describes the incumbent, I am always willing to vote for the newcomer. Rep. Marklein is doing an excellent job of staying in touch with his constituents and working to achieve their goals, not his personal agenda. I believe in the phrase, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"" If the people in Shullsburg trust my judgment, they'll know our 51st Assembly District leadership does not need fixing. Vote for Marklein! - Tom Lethlean, mayor, Shullsburg Advocate for the Badger Reuse Plan I recently heard George Archibald, co-founder of the InternationalCraneFoundation, speak about conservation ethics. As you might guess, much of his focus was on the plight of cranes around the world. But he also spoke about Wisconsin's tradition of fostering famous conservationists such as John Muir and Aldo Leopold. When asked by an audience member to suggest one thing individuals could do to further conservation efforts, Archibald didn't ask us to support his foundation's efforts to save cranes or urge us to join a national conservation organization. Instead, he urged us to join forces with the Sauk Prairie Conservation Alliance (saukprairievision.org) in its efforts to advocate for the Badger Reuse Plan (www.co.sauk.wi.us/cpz/badger-reuse-plan) and its endorsement of conservation, restoration and education at the former Badger Army Ammunition site. He has travelled the world finding ways to save birds, conserve and restore habitat and is in a unique position to appreciate the opportunity on the Sauk Prairie. We have a chance to preserve important grassland bird habitat, our namesake prairie, oak savannas, geological features. Perhaps most importantly, we'll have a living laboratory for our next generation of conservationists. Contact Wisconsin Natural Resources Board members, DNR Secretary Cathy Stepp and your legislators to support the Badger Reuse Plan. - Mary Zenker, Sauk City Youngstar rating system a step in right direction In a recent State Journal article, a Wisconsin Department of Children and Families administrator drew a correlation between academic grades and the Youngstar five-star rating system, implemented last year. There has been discussion about what this rating system means. For parents, choosing a child care provider can be a daunting task, more so for parents seeking it for the first time. Placing the care of your child into the hands of a stranger is frightening enough, and it's clear that families are not happy with their child care receiving a ""D"" grade. This analogy places an undue negative connotation on a rating system that is not designed in such a way. Childcare in Wisconsin has been in the news, and not in a good way. The Youngstar system was implemented to improve services and address these issues. While Youngstar may not be perfect, it has moved us in the right direction. There are often less tangible but relevant factors in providing good child care that are not measured in the Youngstar system. The two-star rating is a baseline, a starting point. Obtaining a two-star rating is not easy, and most two-star agencies are providing meaningful services. We ought to be celebrating their efforts. The dialogue we should be having is not about what two-stars means, but rather how we can use all the tools available to ensure that every family in this state has access to quality child care. - Jack McCommon, Milwaukee, executive director, 4C for Children Need good faith negotiation between MTI, School Board What's behind the brave stand taken by the Madison School Board and administration? One can't deny that the interim superintendent and the board were traversing a thin political line to move quickly and pre-emptively while Dane County Circuit Court Judge Juan Colas' reinstatement of collective bargaining remained in effect. Collective bargaining in Madison schools will be standing for one more year, but employees are limping home like Revolutionary War returnees. Not one major concession was given to Madison Teachers Inc. MTI came to the table in good faith, hoping that attitude would be returned. They found Superintendent Jane Belmore and the board had formed a seemingly unfriendly Maginot Line. Were board members really unfriendly? Not all of them, but why the 7-0 vote approving Belmore's ""negotiated"" proposal? That had to be a fictional display of unanimity. It appears the employees were thrown under the bus for ""administrative flexibility"" and an emphasis on ""closing the achievement gap."" In this political climate, who can argue with flexibility and gap closing? But what will the fallout be, especially regarding the carte blanche given to the administration to hire non-union employees. Is this another step toward school privatization and diminution of workers' rights against powers only interested in the bottom line? - Bruce Noble, Madison Key issue is higher debt I am voting for Mitt Romney, not because of the way he exposed the president's lack of depth in the first debate, or Mitt's tax policy or right-to-life stand. Only one issue stands out in all the noise - the more than $16 trillion in national debt. It's taken many years of kicking the can down the road, but here we are with trillions in new Obama debt and no end in sight. If he confiscates all the income of what he refers to as the super rich - small business, corporations, and individuals making more than $250,000 - it would not begin to pay this mess off. In the process his policy will kill business activity, reduce actual tax revenue, and fundamentally stagnate our economy. Or has everyone forgotten Jimmy Carter? Borrowing and spending on things we can't afford doesn't work in my family, your family, or 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Eventually you max out your ability to borrow, you can no longer pay the debt service, and the game is up. The lie is that the rich aren't paying their fair share. The real problem is spending not revenue. Take a look again at Greece, and much of Europe, not to mention California, Illinois, and the list goes on and on. Consider these things between now and Election Day. Don't vote for a path that clearly has never worked elsewhere else. - Gene Camarata, Madison Republican mantra falls flat Individually we are motivated by self-interest. But this does not take into consideration others' needs. It isn't until we collect together and respond to each other's needs that we also become motivated by group-interest. The Republican mantra that privatization is always better, and that states should always have more power than the federal government, is infuriating in its ignorance. The anti-federalist mantra obviously has forgotten the entrenched racial segregation in schools and social living that has thrived in many states over our history. The anti-public ownership mantra has forgotten the horrendous history of conglomerate and corporate abuse of workers over our history.

93034,1250 words,Lincoln Journal Star (Nebraska),A; Pg. 1,"A lot like life, hunting doesn't require hands",1999,"NEAR OVERTON -- In the dark of a Platte River pre-dawn, the hunt-er gathers a shotgun, coat, shells and several duck calls. ""It's been terrible,"" Gregg Silver-berg laments, describing the latest of his annual December waterfowl hunts in central Nebraska. ""With this weather, I've shot two ducks in four days."" Although he would never say so -- boasting of one's shooting prow-ess is taboo -- those who've hunted alongside Silverberg would guess if he bagged two ducks, he likely had two chances. The 37-year-old Lin-coln man is a crack shot. After a half-mile walk to the hunting spot, Silverberg goes to work. He rolls back a tarp covering the blind, a wood-frame structure partially buried in sand and camou-flaged by bunches of cattails, broom straw and prairie hay. Then he turns to decoys piled in a flat-bottomed boat. Looping the tow rope into the crook of his arm, he drags the heavy boat to an ankle-deep channel of the Platte and places plastic sculptures of Canada geese and mallard ducks in the riv-er. When finished with that chore, he hides the empty boat and slips into the blind. After carefully arranging his gun in the corner, he hangs the call lanyard from his neck and says to others in the blind, ""If anyone wants, I'll cook some coffee."" With a long-handled lighter, he summons a blue flame from a pro-pane stove, lifts the lid of a camp coffee pot and holds it steady while water is poured. Fifteen minutes lat-er, all four occupants of the blind cautiously sip piping-hot coffee from foam cups. ""At least it's going to be a pretty sunrise,"" says Chris Erickson of Holdrege, a childhood friend. Silver-berg looks through a gap in the broom straw and scans the eastern sky. Over the next 30 minutes, the deep, steel blue gradually, almost imperceptibly, yields to fire orange, then ocher, then blinding white. ""Yes,"" he agrees, ""there's nothing like hunting on the Platte."" Suddenly, Silverberg reaches for one of his calls. He pokes his head through the broom straw and, with the hardwood tube pressed to pursed lips, he sings the song of a lonely hen mallard. At first softly, then increasing in urgency as three ducks speed east with hardly a glance at the decoy spread. Somehow, he manages to keep the call on his mouth with his left arm while regulating the pleadings with the stub of his right arm. It sounds just like he's cupping the call with a hand. Phyllis Silverberg couldn't believe it when they said her newborn son didn't have hands ... ""I said, ""He doesn't have either hand? Not either hand?'"" the 63-year-old Holdrege woman said, recalling that day 37 years ago. Doctors said the boy lacked the gene that would have developed hands. His arms stopped at the joint that would have been the wrist. She and her husband, Norris, took him to specialists in Lincoln and Omaha. They struggled to sort out the bewildering advice: Leave him barefoot so he can learn to eat with his feet; fit him with metal prostheses (hooks); allow a surgeon to make vertical cuts in the stubs so he could develop ""crab-like"" appendages. The farm implement dealer and his wife balanced the advice with parental common sense. They decided early on they wanted their son to develop independence. ""We helped him when he needed it, but we tried to let him do it on his own,"" Norris Silverberg said. ""We couldn't help him with everything."" The one thing Gregg desperately wanted to do was learn to hunt. His father and uncle were hunting companions, who took the boy with them on many outings. When Gregg was about 12, his father took him to the Holdrege Gun Club for a shooting lesson. He tried to fire a .410 shotgun while wearing ""the hooks,"" but he couldn't feel the trigger. His father modified the shotgun by enlarging the trigger guard to allow room for the left stub and he attached a leather boot to the gun's forearm, which gave the boy a firm hold. The modifications worked beautifully. From that day on Gregg was done with the hooks. He told his parents, and they agreed. The next time he saw his specialist in Lincoln, he told him he wouldn't use them anymore. ""He said, ""If you don't wear those things, you'll never amount to nothing,'"" Silverberg recalled. ""My dad said I looked at him and said, ""You just watch me.'"" What can he do without hands? It's shorter to list the things he can't do ... Tie shoes. Cut a steak. Use a typewriter. There are other tasks that require dexterity in small, tight spaces, but the self-described ""stubborn, bull-headed"" Silverberg will do most things with what he calls his ""stubs."" He can write. He can drive, automatic or manual -- there are no restrictions on his driver's license. He's worked for 16 years as a farm inspector at Union Bank in Lincoln. He can pick up a dime from a smooth surface and put it in his pocket. He can feed shotgun shells in a magazine, calls geese as good as anybody and shoots better than most. Made the trap teams in high school and college and once broke 198 out of 200 clay targets. But if he can't do it, he'll ask for help. That was one of the hardest lessons to learn. When he was a teenager, if he dropped change and somebody bent down to pick it up for him, he'd turn and walk away. He didn't want help. Now he recognizes people want to help if they can, and by accepting it when necessary, he helps them feel more comfortable. Now, when someone mentions they're impressed by all he can do, Silverberg credits the people who helped him develop confidence and independence -- his friends and his family. And help works both ways. The time Silverberg spends hunting each year represents just a fraction of the time he gives to wildlife conservation efforts. He is deeply involved with DucksUnlimited, a national nonprofit group that raises money for wetlands restoration and waterfowl conservation. He also volunteers time to the Nebraska Chapter of SafariClubInternational and the Nebraska Council of Sportsmen's Clubs. ""He's not just a member, he's always in the center of the activity,"" said Dave Ellingson of Lincoln, a DucksUnlimited volunteer who has known Silverberg for years. ""He's a central, driving force."" Getting involved just seemed logical to Silverberg, who said, ""You've got to help put back what you take."" That's why DucksUnlimited named Silverberg ""Sportsman of the Year"" at its Lincoln banquet last September. He was a unanimous selection and many felt the recognition was long overdue. His slate-colored eyes peer into a bluebird sky as if he is trying to will a mallard to appear on whistling wings ... When the ducks don't fly -- like they're not flying today -- a man has time to think. Gregg Silverberg thinks about giving back some more. ""I'd love to set up a blind to take kids with handicaps hunting,"" he says. ""I really want to do that."" He'd be a natural role model. He understands the frustrations, knowing when to help and when to let them try on their own. Silverberg's eyes hold the smile after it has left his face. Those eyes can see a duck flying behind a line of trees a quarter-mile or more from the blind. Sharp eyesight distinguishes great waterfowlers. ""The good Lord blessed me with good eyes,"" he says. It's a telling comment. Never does he curse his lack of hands. Once, a wealthy neighbor in Holdrege offered to donate his hands after his death; he even offered to pay for the transplant surgery. Silverberg thought about it for a few days and graciously declined. He's grateful for what he's got. ""This is the way the good Lord wants me to be,"" he says. ""He made me this way. I'll be able to adapt.""","['is', 'ducksunlimit', 'rais', 'volunt', 'said', 'ducksunlimit', 'has', 'known', 'hes', 'get', 'involv', 'seem', 'silverberg', 'said', 'got', 'help', 'put', 'tak', 'ducksunlimit', 'nam', 'was', 'felt', 'was', 'peer', 'is', 'try', 'appear', 'whistl', 'dont', 'fly', 'fly', 'has', 'think']",155,33,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,['volunt'],1,[],0,['volunt'],1,"['said', 'said', 'nam']",3,5
154984,546 words,Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News,COMMENTARY,EDITORIAL: A Step Closer to Offshore Wind Power,2011,"Feb. 15--The potential for capturing wind energy off the coast of Virginia received a huge boost last week with an announcement from the federal government that energy companies could be allowed to install wind turbines within three years. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar appeared with Energy Secretary Steven Chu in Norfolk to detail a quicker permitting process and the availability of $50 million in grants for research and development of the renewable energy source. ""The wind potential of the Atlantic Coast is staggering,"" said Salazar, who pointed out that the nation's only approved offshore wind farm is off the coast of Cape Cod, Mass. But that, he said, took 10 years for all the permits -- a time frame he called ""much too long."" As The Daily Press in Newport News reported, the Interior Department will issue leases by the end of the year or early 2012 in four zones off the coasts of Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and New Jersey. More detailed reviews from the Defense Department, environmental activists and other stakeholders would follow, taking from two to three years. From there, companies could place turbines in the water, but industry leaders have said it would take longer than that because the turbines are still on the drawing board and the infrastructure, such as transmission lines, isn't in place. The zone under consideration for Virginia is about 12 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach. It's part of an area a research consortium said could provide 3,200 megawatts of electricity, or roughly 10 percent of the state's power use. The turbines would not be visible from shore, one problem the Nantucket wind farm project encountered. The area is also outside of NASA's Wallops' rocket-launching range and the Navy's live-ordnance ranges. Federal grants for the project will be awarded over the next five years to companies that will design turbines and conduct environmental and economic research. A transmission line could run from the turbines under water to a Dominion Virginia Power substation in Virginia Beach. A Dominion Power spokesman said the utility will bid for the lease area. The wind farm off the Atlantic coast, if it comes to fruition, will have the blessing of the NationalWildlifeFederation and other environmental groups. Catherine Bowes, senior policy representative at the federation, said, ""Offshore wind holds great potential to create jobs, cut pollution, and reduce our reliance on dirty fossil fuels. It is time for America to move forward boldly and responsibly with clean energy, and we applaud the administration showing leadership to accelerate offshore wind development."" The Interior Department's announcement comes as a step toward cleaner energy for America and another step away from reliance on oil, much of which continues to come from the Middle East. The announcement also clearly signals that offshore wind will be a part of the energy future for Virginia -- and America.

JERRY E. SMITH, Circuit Judge: Console supervisors at a refinery alleged that their employer, CITGO Refining and Chemicals Company, L.P. (""CITGO""), misclassified them as exempt from the overtime pay requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act (""FLSA""), 29 U.S.C.  201-219. In two separate discovery sanctions, the district court dismissed twenty-one of twenty-four plaintiffs.1 After granting CITGO's motion to exclude testimony regarding damages by the three remaining plaintiffs, the court granted summary judgment for CITGO based on plaintiffs' inability to prove damages; the court, however, reduced CITGO's award of taxable costs. We affirm the summary judgment but reverse and render the award of costs. I. CITGO served plaintiffs with requests for discovery and interrogatories. After CITGO alleged that plaintiffs' responses were deficient, the district court entered its first discovery order, requiring plaintiffs to produce documents and respond to interrogatories. CITGO again complained of plaintiffs' continued non compliance, whereupon the court entered a second discovery order requiring 1 Initially, twenty-six plaintiffs sued; the district court dismissed two who had abandoned their claims. This appeal concerns only the twenty-four remaining plaintiffs. 2 Case: 12-41292 Document: 00512437666 Page: 2 Date Filed: 11/12/2013 No. 12-41175 No. 12-41292 plaintiffs to preserve documents, respond to specific interrogatories, and produce documents. The court scheduled an evidentiary hearing and warned that ""[p]laintiffs who are found to have violated this Court's Order to preserve their notes and/or documents, will have their claims dismissed."" After two evidentiary hearings that included live testimony from eighteen plaintiffs, the court concluded that seventeen of them ""had failed to participate in discovery, failed to properly supplement responses, and failed to preserve documents."" Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2)(A)(v), the court dismissed the claims of all seventeen as a discovery sanction.2 CITGO moved for summary judgment on the merits, contending that the seven remaining plaintiffs were exempt from the overtime-pay requirements of the FLSA pursuant to the exemptions for administrative, executive, combination, and highly compensated employees; and that liability, if any, must be calculated pursuant to the fluctuating-workweek method and was subject to a twoyear statute of limitations. The court did not rule on CITGO's summaryjudgment motion before four additional plaintiffs were dismissed for further discovery violations. As part of its second discovery order, the court instructed plaintiffs to ""produce either: (1) the emails that are responsive to Interrogatory No. 16 and/or Request for Production No. 41; or (2) a list of all of their respective personal email addresses, along with the relevant account names and passwords. . . . ."" Further, ""[i]f any Plaintiff deletes any of his personal emails after the date of the 2 Rule 37(b)(2)(A)(v) provides, in relevant part, that ""[i]f a party . . . fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery . . . the court where the action is pending may issue further just orders . . . includ[ing] . . . dismissing the action or proceeding in whole or in part . . . ."" 3 Case: 12-41292 Document: 00512437666 Page: 3 Date Filed: 11/12/2013 No. 12-41175 No. 12-41292 entry of this Order, the Court will impose on that Plaintiff a monetary sanction of one hundred dollars ($100) for each deleted email."" Among the plaintiffs who elected to disclose their email accounts and passwords, three deleted emails notwithstanding the order, and a fourth made no effort to preserve the contents of his inbox. Following a further evidentiary hearing, the court gave the offending plaintiffs the option of ""either: (1) dismissal of their claims against CITGO with prejudice; or (2) . . . monetary sanctions . . . . Plaintiffs elected to dismiss their claims against CITGO with prejudice."" Giving no reasons, the court denied CITGO's motion for summary judgment as to the three remaining plaintiffs. It then granted CITGO's motion to prevent those plaintiffs from testifying at trial about damages, because ""after over a year of discovery, not one Plaintiff has yet to provide CITGO with any calculation or estimation of the damages he is seeking."" See FED. R. CIV. P. 37(b)- (2)(A)(ii). Plaintiffs, moreover, had failed timely to designate an expert on damages, and the court had denied their motion to designate out of time. Because plaintiffs had no way of proving an essential element, CITGO's ensuing motion for summary judgment on damages was unopposed. The district court granted that motion, dismissed plaintiffs' claims with prejudice, and entered final judgment in favor of CITGO. Although CITGO submitted a bill of costs for more than $50,000,3 the court awarded only $5000, based in part on a finding of CITGO's ""enormous wealth"" and plaintiffs' ""limited resources."" Both parties appeal. Plaintiffs contend that the district court erred by (1) entering discovery sanctions dismissing seventeen plaintiffs (the ""January 3 CITGO requested $53,065.72 for deposition transcripts and $2,262.41 for copies. The court denied reimbursement for the latter, a ruling that CITGO does not appeal. 4 Case: 12-41292 Document: 00512437666 Page: 4 Date Filed: 11/12/2013 No. 12-41175 No. 12-41292 Sanction""); (2) entering discovery sanctions dismissing four additional plaintiffs (the ""March Sanction""); and (3) dismissing the three remaining plaintiffs after preventing them from testifying about damages. CITGO (4) re-urges its motion on the merits as an alternative ground for summary judgment against the final three plaintiffs and (5) avers that the court erred by reducing its cost award. II. ""A district court has broad discretion in all discovery matters, and such discretion will not be disturbed ordinarily unless there are unusual circumstances showing a clear abuse."" Kelly v.

Cooper Tire & Rubber Co., 685 F.3d 486, 488 (5th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because plaintiffs do not allege a legal error, i.e., it is undisputed that the district court applied the correct test; the only question is whether it clearly erred in its findings of fact. ""Clear error review is especially rigorous when we review a lower court's assessment of trial testimony, because the trier of fact has seen and judged the witnesses.""

""[D]ismissal is a severe sanction that implicates due process."" FDIC v. Conner, 20 F.3d 1376, 1380 (5th Cir. 1994). Rule 37 dismissal, however ""must be available to the district court in appropriate cases, not merely to penalize those whose conduct may be deemed to warrant such a sanction, but to deter those who might be tempted to such conduct in the absence of such a deterrent."" Nat'l Hockey League v. Metro. Hockey Club, Inc., 427 U.S. 639, 643 (1976) (per curiam). ""The question . . . is not . . . whether the Court of Appeals [ ] would as an original matter have dismissed the action; it is whether the District Court abused its discretion in so doing."" Id. at 642. The Court's Rule 37 dismissal guidance is but a specific application of its general instructions regarding clear error review: ""If the district court's account of the evidence is plausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of appeals may not reverse it even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently."" Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., 470 U.S. 564, 573-74 (1985). [S]everal factors [""Conner factors""] must be present before a district court may dismiss a case with prejudice as a sanction for violating a discovery order: (1) ""the refusal to comply results from willfulness or bad faith and is accompanied by a clear record of delay or contumacious conduct;"" (2) the violation of the discovery order must be attributable to the client instead of the attorney, (3) the violating party's misconduct ""must substantially prejudice the opposing party;"" and (4) a less drastic sanction would not substantially achieve the desired deterrent effect. Doe v. Am. Airlines, 283 F. App'x 289, 291 (5th Cir. 2008) (per curiam) (quoting Conner, 20 F.3d at 1380-81); accord GREGORY P. JOSEPH, supra,  49(B)(4), 6 Case: 12-41292 Document: 00512437666 Page: 6 Date Filed: 11/12/2013 No. 12-41175 No. 12-41292 at 740 (quoting Conner, 20 F.3d at 1380-81). After hearing two days of testimony and making specific findings regarding each of eighteen plaintiffs (January Sanction), the court addressed each factor in detail. As a preliminary matter, plaintiffs contend that an alleged ambiguity in the second discovery order deprived them of ""fair notice that their claims were subject to dismissal at the evidentiary hearing."" They cite no authority for that proposition, and notice is not among the Conner factors governing dismissal. As a factual matter, moreover, the order was unambiguous: ""Plaintiffs who are found to have violated this Court's Order to preserve their notes and/or documents, will have their claims dismissed."" The court made specific findings, moreover, that each and every dismissed plaintiff failed to preserve documents. Plaintiffs maintain that their violation of the discovery order was only negligent. The district court, however, inferred wilfulness from conduct: ""Plaintiffs were aware of the Court's rulings, and nevertheless failed to conduct themselves in accordance with them. This failure evidences a blatant disregard for the judicial process, and constitutes willful and contumacious conduct."" The court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to credit, following substantial testimony, plaintiffs' claims that their disobedience was grounded in confusion or sincere misunderstanding. Their failure to request clarification of the order militates against such a finding. See Worrell v. Hous. Can! Academy, 424 F. App'x 330, 337 (5th Cir. 2011) (per curiam). Even if such a reading is plausible, the district court's opposite conclusion--reached after a detailed examination of each plaintiff's conduct--was not implausible. ""Where there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous."" Anderson, 470 U.S. at 574. 7 Case: 12-41292 Document: 00512437666 Page: 7 Date Filed: 11/12/2013 No. 12-41175 No. 12-41292 Plaintiffs assert that their failure to preserve handwritten notes and personal emails did not substantially prejudice CITGO. Plaintiffs testified that their work notes contained information that was not available in electronic records or elsewhere. It was therefore not clear error for the district court to conclude that ""the notes Plaintiffs routinely destroyed or failed to preserve would have been the best evidence of their daily tasks."" (January Sanction.) Although conceding it possessed information regarding the duration of plaintiffs' internet use, CITGO asserts those records are not accurate proxy for how much time was spent on personal email while on the clock. The district court specifically found, however, that ""emails go directly to two of Defendant's defenses"" (January Sanction), and CITGO's prospective trial exhibits included more than twenty emails from the one then-remaining plaintiff who used personal email at work. The prejudice finding was not clearly erroneous. Plaintiffs contend that dismissal was improper because a less drastic sanction would have achieved the desired effect. They rely primarily on district court and out-of-circuit cases, but this circuit has rejected the view that a court is ""required to attempt to coax [parties] into compliance with its order by imposing incrementally increasing sanctions."" United States v. $49,000 Currency, 330 F.3d 371, 379 (5th Cir. 2003). The district court dismissed the seventeen plaintiffs only after issuing two discovery orders, one of which specifically warned that dismissal would be the penalty for noncompliance. The court, moreover, entered specific factual findings regarding each plaintiff--and, notably, did not dismiss one plaintiff whom it found to be in compliance. (January Sanction.) On this record, we find no 8 Case: 12-41292 Document: 00512437666 Page: 8 Date Filed: 11/12/2013 No. 12-41175 No. 12-41292 abuse of discretion, notwithstanding the severity of the sanction.4 Discovery rulings--especially those taken after live testimony--are peculiarly within the competence of the district court, and the factual findings at issue here are no exception. Plaintiffs' briefing does not focus on (or even distinguish) their individual courses of conduct, as the district court did, so their claim must be that the district court got it wrong regarding all seventeen dismissed plaintiffs. That is an implausible result, given the plaintiff-specific findings and careful application of each Conner factor to the facts. We therefore affirm the January Sanction. III. In its March Sanction, the district court dismissed four additional plaintiffs who disclosed their personal email addresses and passwords after the second discovery order but then either deleted emails or, in the case of one plaintiff, failed to preserve inbox contents. The dismissal again occurred after live testimony, plaintiff-specific findings, and application of the Conner factors. There was no abuse of discretion. Three plaintiffs deleted emails in direct 4 See Emerick v. Fenick Indus., Inc., 539 F.2d 1379, 1381 (5th Cir. 1976) (""It is not our responsibility as a reviewing court to say whether we would have chosen a more moderate sanction. It is our responsibility solely to decide whether the district court could, in its discretion, have determined the appellant's conduct to be so flagrant as to justify [the sanctions at issue].""); see also Nat'l Hockey League, 427 U.S. at 643 (""It might well be that [t]hese [plaintiffs] would faithfully comply with all future discovery orders entered by the District Court in this case. But other parties to other lawsuits would feel freer than we think Rule 37 contemplates they should feel to flout other discovery orders of other district courts. Under the circumstances of this case, we hold that the District Judge did not abuse his discretion in finding bad faith on the part of these respondents, and concluding that the extreme sanction of dismissal was appropriate in this case . . . .""). 9 Case: 12-41292 Document: 00512437666 Page: 9 Date Filed: 11/12/2013 No. 12-41175 No. 12-41292 contradiction of an order--and despite dismissal of their co-plaintiffs, in part, for similar conduct--and a fourth thwarted the order through inaction. Plaintiffs again attribute their conduct to negligence or misunderstanding rather than wilfulness. The district court, however, characterized that explanation as ""particularly disingenuous and offensive in light of the fact that seventeen co-plaintiffs were previously dismissed raising these same tired excuses."" The plaintiffs had at least constructive notice of the second discovery order; allowing parties to avoid sanctions by not reading documents in their own case would erode courts' ability to enforce their lawful edicts. The implicit finding of wilfulness was not clearly erroneous. To the extent plaintiffs have preserved a claim that their noncompliance did not prejudice CITGO, the court did not abuse its discretion by finding that ""[t]he discovery that was destroyed by plaintiffs may have been essential to CITGO's defense, and without it, CITGO is certainly disadvantaged. Moreover, CITGO has expended considerable funds in pursuing discovery that has led nowhere."" Particularly unpersuasive, in the context of the March Sanction, is plaintiffs' contention regarding a lesser sanction. Plaintiffs elected dismissal with prejudice in lieu of the very sanction they now seek ($100 per deleted email). They did not challenge that choice at the time and will not now be heard to repudiate it. The four plaintiffs dismissed in the March Sanction, moreover, were not in fact deterred by either the discovery orders or the earlier dismissal of seventeen co-plaintiffs for similar conduct. There is no showing that any lesser sanction would have been effective. 10 Case: 12-41292 Document: 00512437666 Page: 10 Date Filed: 11/12/2013 No. 12-41175 No. 12-41292 IV. The district court made three significant determinations regarding damages. The court denied the request of the seven remaining plaintiffs to designate a damages expert out of time. It subsequently barred the final three plaintiffs from testifying to damages. Summary judgment on damages followed. It is somewhat unclear which of these issues, if any, plaintiffs have preserved on appeal. Our independent review of the record shows that neither the denial of plaintiffs' untimely motion to designate an expert nor the discovery sanction preventing their direct testimony on damages was an abuse of discretion. At most, plaintiffs' initial brief could be generously construed as a compound argument that the two rulings on damages, followed by summary judgment, erroneously prohibited them from presenting evidence of damages. Although plaintiffs have explained why they failed timely to designate an expert (which failure they concede), they have not shown that the denial of their motion to do so after the deadline was reversible error. There is no evidence, other than plaintiffs' ipse dixit, that the court ordered an off-the-record ""stand-down"" on discovery or that such stand-down, even if ordered, tolled the deadline for designating an expert. The subsequent order barring plaintiffs from testifying about damages is a sanction that is expressly permitted by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)- (2)(A)(ii). Whether the district court abused its discretion in deploying it is determined by examining ""(1) the importance of the witnesses' testimony; (2) the prejudice to the opposing party of allowing the witnesses to testify; (3) the possibility of curing such prejudice by granting a continuance; and (4) the explana- 11 Case: 12-41292 Document: 00512437666 Page: 11 Date Filed: 11/12/2013 No. 12-41175 No. 12-41292 tion, if any, for the party's failure to comply with the discovery order."" SierraClub v. Cedar Point Oil Co., 73 F.3d 546, 572 (5th Cir. 1996). In applying the SierraClub factors, the court determined that there was no good explanation for plaintiffs' delay in providing damages calculations and that allowing testimony without discovery would prejudice CITGO.5 That ""evidence of damages is an essential element of Plaintiffs' FLSA claims"" militates in favor of allowing it, notwithstanding any discovery violations. The court made no explicit finding regarding a continuance, though we note that the trial was continued for eight months after denial of plaintiffs' motion to designate an expert out of time. Considering them holistically, the SierraClub factors weigh in favor of a finding that the court did not abuse its discretion. Especially important is that, ""after over a year of discovery, not one Plaintiff ha[d] yet . . . provide[d] CITGO with any calculation or estimation of . . . damages""--""despite the fact that they had in their possession . . . badge records and the Court had specifically informed Plaintiffs that they could provide their 'best estimate.'"" CITGO's eventual motion for summary judgment on damages was unopposed, and the district court found no remaining issues of material fact. Having consented to the judgment, plaintiffs cannot challenge it for the first time on appeal. See Nissho-Iwai Am. Corp. v. Kline, 845 F.2d 1300, 1307 (5th Cir. 1988).6 5 See also FED. R. CIV.

""Unless a federal statute, the [Federal Rules], or a court order provides otherwise, costs--other than attorney's fees--should be allowed to the prevailing party."" FED. R. CIV. P. 54(d)(1). ""Because the Rule authorizes the district court to deny the award, we review that exercise of authority for abuse of discretion."" Pacheco v. Mineta, 448 F.3d 783, 793 (5th Cir. 2006). It follows that a reduction in a cost award is likewise reviewed for abuse of discretion. In Pacheco, the court cited a leading treatise for the proposition that ""[a] wide range of reasons have been invoked to justify withholding costs from the prevailing party."" Id. at 794 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The court enumerated illustrative reasons, but ""only for the purpose of exposition."" Id. at 794 n.18. It expressly declined to ""decide whether any of these is a sufficient reason to deny costs."" Id. (emphasis added). Although it is undisputed that CITGO is the prevailing party, the district court reduced CITGO's cost award based on (1) a finding of plaintiffs' good faith, (2) CITGO's ""enormous wealth,"" and (3) ""Plaintiffs['] limited resources."" The court erred as a matter of law in relying on CITGO's ""enormous wealth""--or the comparative wealth of the parties--as a basis for reducing the cost award. Neither the district court nor plaintiffs have invoked any Fifth Circuit authority other than Pacheco's descriptive list. At least four circuits, however, have rejected a ""relative wealth"" rationale, and ""[t]he fact that the prevailing party 6(...continued) the alternative grounds proffered by CITGO. We decline to consider whether the district court erred by denying CITGO's initial motion for summary judgment on the merits, because plaintiffs were properly classified as exempt under the FLSA. 13 Case: 12-41292 Document: 00512437666 Page: 13 Date Filed: 11/12/2013 No. 12-41175 No. 12-41292 is substantially more wealthy than the losing party is not a sufficient ground for denying or limiting costs to the prevailing party.""7 [T]he plain language of Rule 54(d) does not contemplate a court basing awards on a comparison of the parties' financial strengths. To do so would not only undermine the presumption that Rule 54(d)(1) creates in prevailing parties' favor, but it would also undermine the foundation of the legal system that justice is administered to all equally, regardless of wealth or status. Cherry, 186 F.3d at 448. Thus, Congress did not intend Rule 54(d) to be swallowed by an ""enormous"" or ""relative"" wealth exception: As a practical matter, the approach adopted by the district court would be impermissibly punitive by preventing profitable corporations such as CITGO from recovering costs when litigating against individuals acting in good faith. Consistent with the great weight of authority from the federal circuits, reducing or eliminating a prevailing party's cost award based on its wealth--either relative or absolute--is impermissible as a matter of law. It is not entirely evident whether the district court intended plaintiffs' ""limited resources"" to be an independent basis for the cost reduction or whether, 7 10 JAMES W.

In any event, we recognize that some circuits have permitted alteration of a cost award based on a combined finding of good faith and limited resources.8 The parties agree, however, that the question of what role ""limited resources"" play in reducing an award presents a question of first impression in the Fifth Circuit. On these facts, we decline to disturb the careful balance established by the Federal Rules, which provide that taxable costs are presumptively awarded to the prevailing party. Where, as here, the prevailing party incurred a few thousand dollars per plaintiff in carefully documented out-of-pocket expenses for taking depositions, and those plaintiffs were making in the neighborhood of $100,000 per year, it would have been reversible error for the district court to reduce the cost award based on a finding of ""limited resources.""9 The summary judgment is AFFIRMED. The order reducing costs is REVERSED, and a cost award is RENDERED in favor of CITGO for $53,065.72. 8 E.g., Moore v. Cnty. of Delaware, 586 F.3d 219, 221-22 (2d Cir. 2009); Champion Produce, Inc. v.

Motors Corp., 721 F.2d 1152, 1157 (8th Cir. 1983). 9 This conclusion regarding ""limited resources"" has no bearing on whether a losing party who has demonstrated indigency may properly be excused from paying a prevailing party's costs or may properly be permitted to pay reduced costs. See 10 JAMES W. MOORE ET AL., supra,  54.101[1][b], at 54-157 (""Most circuits hold that a substantiated claim of the losing party's indigency may justify a reduction . . . of costs . . . .""). As their attorney conceded at oral argument, plaintiffs are not indigent, nor did the district court make a finding to that effect. 15 Case: 12-41292 Document: 00512437666 Page: 15 Date Filed: 11/12/2013 No. 12-41175 No. 12-41292 DENNIS, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur in Parts II and III of the majority's opinion, holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion by sanctioning Plaintiffs whom it found had repeatedly and willfully violated discovery orders. I likewise join the majority's conclusion in Part IV that the district court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the Plaintiffs' testimony on damages, denying the untimely designation of an expert on damages, and ultimately granting summary judgment for CITGO. However, I respectfully dissent from Section V of the majority opinion because I believe the district court was well within its discretion to reduce CITGO's cost award based on the circumstances of this case and the comparatively disparate financial resources of the parties. I. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d), a district court may award costs to a prevailing party. An appellate court reviews a district court's cost award under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. Energy Mgmt. Corp. v. City of Shreveport, 467 F.3d 471, 483 (5th Cir. 2006). A district court that denies or reduces a cost award to a prevailing party must articulate justifications for so doing. Id.

Mineta, 448 F.3d 783 (5th Cir. 2006), this court held that in conjunction with a finding that the non-prevailing party brought suit in good faith, district courts may consider various factors to determine what, if any, costs should be awarded to the prevailing party. The Pacheco factors include: ""(1) the 16 Case: 12-41292 Document: 00512437666 Page: 16 Date Filed: 11/12/2013 No. 12-41175 No. 12-41292 losing party's limited financial resources; (2) misconduct by the prevailing party; (3) close and difficult legal issues presented; (4) substantial benefit conferred to the public; and (5) the prevailing party's enormous financial resources."" Id. at 794 (citing 10 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE  2668, at 234 (1998)). As noted by the majority, this Court in Pacheco explained in a footnote that the five enumerated factors were listed ""only for the purpose of exposition. [We did not] decide whether any of these is a sufficient reason to deny costs."" Id. at 794 n.18. II. After final judgment was entered in CITGO's favor, CITGO filed a motion seeking costs of approximately $53,000. On November 26, 2012, the district court issued an opinion, awarding CITGO $5,000 in costs. The district court applied Pacheco and found that despite the discovery disputes in this case, there was no record evidence to conclude that Plaintiffs filed suit in bad faith. The court further found that although the issues were in dispute, they were ""neither novel or complex."" The district court then considered the resources of the parties, finding that CITGO has ""enormous wealth"" and that Plaintiffs have ""limited resources."" Because of the disparity in financial resources between the parties, the court found that the amount of costs ""requested by CITGO would amount to an additional sanction, and is not appropriate."" Furthermore, the court noted, in its discussion of attorneys' fees, that four Plaintiffs had previously elected to dismiss their claims against CITGO rather than incur monetary sanctions. ""Those Plaintiffs voluntarily elected dismissal of their claims, and as such avoided imposition of a monetary sanction. . . . The dismissal of their claims adequately addressed the proven discovery violations."" 17 Case: 12-41292 Document: 00512437666 Page: 17 Date Filed: 11/12/2013 No. 12-41175 No. 12-41292 III. Looking to case law from four sister-circuits, the majority opinion concludes that ""reducing or eliminating a party's cost award based on its wealth--either relative or absolute--is impermissible as a matter of law."" I respectfully disagree that a consideration of the parties' financial resources is impermissible as a matter of law. Rather, our very own case law under Pacheco, the text of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d)(1), as well as persuasive case law from three sister-circuits suggest otherwise.

Hewlett said yesterday that it opposes the company's proposed merger with rival computer maker Compaq. Later yesterday, David W. Packard, the only son of the other Hewlett-Packard co-founder, David Packard, said he decided to join Hewlett in opposing HP's proposed acquisition of Compaq, Knight Ridder reported. Walter B. Hewlett, an HP director and the late William R. Hewlett's son, said in a statement that ""after careful deliberation, consultation with my financial adviser, and consideration of developments since the announcement of the merger, I have decided to vote against the transaction. I believe that Hewlett-Packard can create greater value for stockholders as a stand-alone company than as a company combined with Compaq."" Knight Ridder quoted Packard as saying, ""I agree with Walter's statement that gave a lot of business reasons this merger is a bad deal, and I share all of those reasons."" Hewlett's statement said that Hewlett family members, as well as the William R. Hewlett Revocable Trust, would vote against the merger. With 100 million shares, or 5 percent of the company's stock, the Hewlett family cannot stop the deal by themselves. But negative votes by the Hewletts and the Packards could present an insurmountable obstacle for the proposed $ 25 billion merger, whose value has sunk to $ 21 billion because HP's stock price has declined. Packard also said the Packard Humanities Institute, which he founded and which owns more than 25 million HP shares, would not vote its shares to support the proposed merger, Knight Ridder reported. Packard was careful to say that he was not speaking for other family members or for the DavidandLucilePackardFoundation, chaired by his sister, Susan Packard Orr. That foundation, started by his parents in 1964, controls 10.4 percent of HP stock, making it the company's largest single shareholder. Walter Hewlett's and David Packard's arguments echo the doubts Wall Street has had since the two companies announced the merger in September. That day -- when Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina announced what she called a ""game-changing move"" to employees -- HP shares fell nearly 19 percent and Compaq shares slid 10 percent; by comparison, HP stock jumped $ 2.92, to $ 19.81, yesterday as investors responded positively to Hewlett's statement. Compaq shares were down 49 cents, or nearly 6 percent, at $ 8.50. In response to Hewlett's statement, the computer manufacturer released its own. ""While we regret very much the Hewlett family's decision, we are not surprised,"" it read. ""The HP Board of Directors and HP and Compaq remain fully committed to the merger and expect shareowner approval."" The combined market share in personal computers of the proposed company, to be called Hewlett-Packard, would surpass that of Dell Computer Corp., the industry leader. It would also be a major player in printers and servers, the powerful computers that direct traffic on the Internet and in company networks.","['was', 'say', 'was', 'speak', 'chair', 'start', 'mak', 'echo', 'wal', 'has', 'had', 'annount', 'annount', 'cal', 'fel', 'slid', 'jump', 'respond', 'hewlet']",117,19,['cal'],1,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,"['speak', 'annount', 'annount', 'respond']",4,[],0,"['say', 'annount', 'annount', 'respond']",4,9

W. Norton, 254pp, Dollars 21.00 ISBN 0 393 03590 5 ULTIMATE SECURITY: THE ENVIRONMENTAL BASIS OF POLITICAL STABILITY BY NORMAN MYERS W. W. Norton, 308pp, Pounds 17.95 ISBN 0 393 03545 X I was recently at a 90th birthday celebration where the very lively honorand gave it as his opinion that there were two types of people in the world: the go-getters and the tooth-suckers. There seemed to be no intermediate categories nor did individuals migrate from one group to the other. I was reminded of this when reading the Myers-Simon 'debate' recorded in the first of these books, for it seems clear that here are not merely two different intellectual approaches founded on rational inspections of evidence but two contrasting world views: one founded in a go-getting faith in western notions of progress and the other based on a profoundly cautious view of the direction that human-environment relations are taking. Those familiar with this type of literature will recognise the signatures of Julian Simon, professor of business administration at the University of Maryland and optimist about the supply of resources, the growth of the human population and the future of the biophysical systems of this planet, and of Norman Myers, an independent writer and environmental consultant, recent author of several books on biodiversity and consistent prophet of the possibility of ecological breakdowns on a large scale. The Myers-Simon book results from a public debate which took place at Columbia University in 1992. The two men were each invited to prepare a 'pre-debate' statement, they then met in public and stated their positions, heard and replied to audience questioning and then wrote a 'post-debate' statement and supplied references and further reading. These segments, in order, form the material of this book, with the subjects of disagreement being mostly resource supply, human population growth, species loss and global-scale environmental contamination. Neither participant alters his stance much from what he has previously published on these topics, and therefore much hinges on what can be extrapolated from statistical trends or read into current technological and political developments. Simon thinks of population as 'the ultimate resource', whereas Myers thinks of extra people as producing more environmental degradation; Simon bets that any indicator of human welfare will show improvements year on year, while Myers is convinced that we are living a few seconds before midnight doom. As the moderator of the debates puts it, there are deeper differences: for Simon the world consists of separable and measurable entities whose trajectory can be defined and given a precise value, but for Myers the globe is organic and Gaian and many of its essential processes and qualities are of a different ontological order to those of Simon. Herein to my mind lies the value of the book. It brings together in a reasonably concise framework two conflicting sets of views and so is a useful tool for anybody needing a brisk introduction to this part of the environmental discourse now in progress. I can envisage it being assigned to students taking the sort of 'free unit' course in 'Environmental Problems' that so many modular programme structures encourage, for it will be equally comprehensible to majors in English literature and engineering. What it will not do, I think, is change the minds of the even half-way committed since the very nature of the arguments deployed allows the adversaries to talk past each other rather than hammering out a 'true' interpretation of a piece of information or a data set. Hence perhaps the rather plaintive statement by the Columbia chairman, that he 'had hoped for a livelier debate with more disagreement between our speakers . . .' A book review is not the place to rehearse my own view on the substantive issues except insofar as it may affect my judgement on the book itself. I will obtrude one verdict, which is that both antagonists sound as if they have a view of the world in which enough is determinate (human ingenuity in one case and ecological disintegration in the other) for good predictions to be made. But one of the lessons emerging from ideas about the nature of the human-environment interaction seems to be that this is better described by notions of chaos and complexity than by systems characterised by determinism. Thus to predict complex system behaviour with better than, say, 66 per cent success, is likely to be rare, especially as continuous historical data is generally incomplete. So the likelihood is that both Simon and Myers will turn out to be wrong, a view that places this reviewer well behind the tooth-suckers - somewhere beyond the Arsenal supporters perhaps. Ultimate Security, the single-author book by Myers, is in the tradition of his earlier work, whose intellectual homeland is that of the Ehrlichs, Lester Brown, Eckholm, and the WorldResourcesInstitute. It is a restatement of the environmentalist case in support of the proposition that environmental degradation leads to conflict and thence to an absence of political stability. As such it is good to have this focus introduced by such an experienced and well-informed writer into the market for the general public. The concept of environmental security is mostly defined with respect to the United States but its wider application is defined as involving all scales of society from the individual to the community of nations. Those who need the lesson will find in the book examples of how resource shortages and the fear of shortages can lead to conflict, how population growth may exacerbate such processes and for example cause migrations which lead to warfare and how predicted global changes (such as those of climate) might induce large-scale conflicts, for instance, on the Indian subcontinent. Curiously, sea-level change is not mentioned in this scenario though it might affect, say, Bangladesh quite seriously. There are some interesting examples and stories, such as the precipitation of the 1967 war in Palestine by the Arab moves to divert the headwaters of the River Jordan, though the map of water resources in the Middle East ignores ground-water, dew and desalinated supplies as parts of the regional water flows. Though conflicts over fish are briefly mentioned at the beginning, there is no development of any of the examples. For higher educational use, much of this material can be found in other sources where it made more comprehensive and immediately accessible by means of, for instance, maps and diagrams, of which this book has very few indeed. Given the capacity of humans to turn almost anything into a grievance, it is certainly not difficult to take most human-environment relationships and say 'here are the seeds of conflict'. What this book most lacks to my mind is any meaningful generalisations: how, for example, does environmental stability/security relate to political stability? Are there any patterns in which the one usually produces the other? Is it in fact in all peoples' interest to have political stability if the regime is a peculiarly nasty one, or based on a discredited ideology? Might not resource shortage lead to a kind of wartime state with stability but no choice for the individual? How might we try to avoid strife in ways other than adopting the household-style recipes (valid for all kinds of other reasons, no doubt) for cutting energy consumption and recycling materials? We have problems and potential problems at many scales, but these are referred to households (mainly in the US, at whom the whole book is clearly directed) for action; though the bigger players are discussed, their failings rather than their necessary potentials are emphasised. In the end, the term 'security' seems to me to have some of the failings of 'sustainability': it sounds like a good thing to aim for but often proves a very elusive (and indeed elastic) concept, especially when no time-frame is specified. Furthermore, while nobody doubts that wars and other struggles can result from environmental degradation and resource shortages, the case for them being necessary outcomes at different scales is not made here. Nevertheless, if a general reading public needs a common enemy now that the Cold War appears to be over, then environmental degradation is a good one. But just as there were good guys on the other side of the Curtain all along, there are good environmental changes brought about by human hands as well as degradations: to discriminate the good ones from the bad ones is a deep challenge for environmentalists everywhere. The problem in all its aspects goes deeper still, of course. We are in a situation where we have to choose between different Goods, and where a Good at one scale becomes a Bad at another. Hence it would be useful to be able to place Ultimate Security alongside a go-getter's approach to this problem: somebody with an 'end of history' approach maybe? Even better would be a debate similar to the one with Simon but more focused. Then we would have a book of distinctive value in a very crowded field. I. G.

Fredericton's annual winter festival is normally held at fields off Sunset Drive, but unseasonably warm temperatures in January caused the area to become flooded with melted snow. This year, the event will be held at Maritime Fibre and Energy's property at 819 Royal Rd. Winterfest founder John Antworth said he expects the new venue will be a positive change. ""With this venue, we'll have more parking space available,"" he said. ""In that way, it could turn out to be superior."" Winterfest was initially scheduled to take place Feb. 6-7, but thanks to two January thaws, the event had to be postponed until the weekend of Feb. 20-21. While the temperature has dropped in early February, Antworth said he would appreciate some more wintry weather. ""I'd rather have some more snow,"" he said. ""The forecast is somewhat favourable as far as temperature, but with any luck a storm or two will hit Fredericton in the next couple of weeks."" Antworth said this year's festival will feature all the attractions people have come to expect and enjoy, including giant ice slides, a snow labyrinth and pony rides, as well as a few new activities. With help from groups such as DucksUnlimited and the University of New Brunswick's Let's Talk Science program, Winterfest will offer a number of educational and interactive activities. Last year the festival, inspired by large events such as Ottawa's Winterlude Festival and Quebec City's winter carnival, attracted more than 10,000 visitors. Despite the changes to the date and location, Antworth said he hopes this year's Winterfest will be just as popular, if not more so. ""Everyone has been understanding and appreciative that we're going ahead despite poor weather conditions last month,"" he said. ""Our organizing committee puts a lot of hard work into planning it, and I would anticipate we'll get the same positive response as in previous years."" Antworth said construction will begin early this week to create ice slides and other structures at the Royal Road site.

82693,414  words,Legal Monitor Worldwide,NA,Court rejects food labeling challenge,2014,"The meatpacking industry has failed to block a federal law requiring food labels that tell consumers whether their meat came from the United States. In a ruling issued Friday, a three-judge panel for the U.S. Appeals Court of the District of Columbia denied an attempt by meatpackers to block Country of Origin Labeling. COOL, as the law is known, requires food labels on meat packages revealing where the meat was born, raised and slaughtered. Meatpackers, led by the American Meat Institute, argue the rule discriminates against foreign beef from Canada and Mexico. They wanted the labels blocked while a lawsuit against COOL plays out.  The ruling was a significant victory for COOL proponents, including two based in Billings that are parties in the lawsuit. ""This clearly demonstrates that their arguments were red herrings,"" said Bill Bullard, CEO of Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund, United Stockgrowers of America, also known as R-CALF. ""They were complaining that the sky was going to fall and it did not, and it continues not to fall."" Billings-based groups R-CALF USA and the Western Organization of Resource Councils petitioned the court to defend COOL. They were joined by Food&WaterWatch and the South Dakota Stockgrowers Association in arguing that COOL was a necessary tool for promoting U.S. meat. U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., was also a key proponent of COOL as it worked its way through the Senate. ""This is a big win for Montana ranchers and American consumers,"" Tester told The Gazette. ""I have strongly supported COOL throughout my time in the Senate because consumers deserve to know where their meat is born, raised, and processed - and when they do, they choose American meat."" COOL has been controversial since its inclusion in the 2002 and 2008 farm bills. The American Meat Institute argues that beef from Canada is no different than the beef from the United States and that labels suggesting otherwise violate trade law. Under the North American Free Trade Agreement, Canada and Mexico were to have fair access to U.S. markets. The COOL labels arrived in supermarkets after the 2008 farm bill, but proponents balked at language that indicated the meat was a product of Mexico, Canada or the United States. Proponents wanted more specific labeling and appeared to get it last May when the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved more detailed labeling. Those labels began showing up in supermarket refrigerator cases last November.  2014 Legal Monitor Worldwide.","['wer', 'join', 'assocy', 'argu', 'was', 'promot', 'meat', 'was', 'work', 'is', 'test', 'told', 'hav', 'support', 'deserv', 'know', 'is', 'born', 'rais', 'process', 'do', 'choos']",91,22,[],0,[],0,['test'],1,['test'],1,['promot'],1,['promot'],1,['support'],1,"['argu', 'promot', 'support']",3,8

Well-managed fisheries that have seen copious scientific study, such as the valuable pollock fishery in Alaska, can serve as a model for developing nations where fish is a vital source of protein for their growing populations. Even collapsed fisheries can recover, said Christopher Costello, one of the lead authors of the study published this week in the journal Science. ""I'm an economist, and I always think it's worth pointing out that the best way for a fishery to provide value to society is to fish that stock sustainably,"" said Costello, of the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara. ""You make more money doing that than, say, catching all the fish today and sticking the money in an investment."" The study, a collaboration of UC Santa Barbara, the University of Washington and California Environmental Associates, a consulting group, offers new population assessments for thousands of fisheries around the globe and takes a close look at the health of those that make up 80 percent of the world's catch. It shows that more than half of the world's fisheries are in decline. But fish stocks where data are plentiful are doing better than the lesser-studied fisheries, regardless of the country managing them. In the U.S., many large fisheries are beginning to recover. Their recovery, the study's authors say, is thanks to setting allowable fishing levels based on science, closing some areas to allow for rebuilding, and using catch shares. Catch shares dedicate a secure share of fish to an individual fisherman, community or fishery association. It's vital to give fishermen a stake in protecting the habitat from which they draw their livelihood, said Amanda Leland, vice president of the EnvironmentalDefenseFund's Oceans Program. Fishermen get the rights to the fisheries, are responsible for managing their sustainability and reap the rewards when the fisheries improve, Leland said. She points to the recovered pollock fisheries of Alaska as success stories. ""Five years ago, I would have been terrified by this report,"" Leland said. ""But today I have hope that we can turn fisheries around and I have confidence that we can actually do it. The revolution here is to empower fishermen to lead the way in recovering fish populations."" On a global scale, the World Bank sees the problems outlined in the report as one of food security and economic development for poorer countries with declining fish stocks. The bank is planning programs to help developing countries build the capacity to manage their fisheries as a way of reducing poverty, said Michael Arbuckle, a senior fisheries specialist with the World Bank's Global Partnership for Oceans. Catch shares aren't without controversy. When they're implemented, not everyone gets a share, or gets the share they wanted, which can drive them out of business. In some places, large commercial seafood interests have come to dominate the citizen-based fisheries councils that set limits and oversee the fisheries. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican who represents the Florida Keys, consistently opposes catch limits because the fishermen who live in her district have asked her to do so. Her office recently opposed federal catch limits on yellowtail snapper. Catch shares may work in other parts of the country, her office said, but the congresswoman doesn't want them in the southeast, particularly without adequate stock assessments. Fisheries managers also can struggle to balance commercial fishing quotas with recreational quotas, such as in Alaska where halibut charter boat captains have seen limits imposed on their catch. The balancing act pits different sectors of the state's economy against each other; halibut charter boats are a vital part of the tourist economy in some parts of the state. Phil Smith, who retired from the National Marine Fisheries Service after overseeing the implementation of Alaska's catch-share program for halibut, fully backs the concept in Alaska. Because they have identifiable limits for the year, fishermen stay home during bad weather, which improves safety. The season is extended, meaning there's product available more consistently, he said. ""They are not a panacea, but they do rationalize the race for fish that occurs when the government   or whatever the authority is   sets a catch limit, then fires a gun and says, 'Go get 'em,'"" Smith said. ""Depending on how you design the program, you can end up with a system that's orderly, clean, and you know what you're allowed to catch.""","['giv', 'protect', 'draw', 'said', 'oc', 'get', 'ar', 'man', 'reap', 'improv', 'said', 'point', 'recov', 'hav', 'been', 'terr', 'said']",75,17,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,"['protect', 'improv']",2,"['said', 'said', 'said']",3,5
84434,560 words,"Spokesman Review (Spokane, WA)",A; Pg. 1,"LOGGING WOULD AVERT FIRE, OTTER SAYS; State control of timber urged at U.S. Capitol;",2012,"Idaho is at big risk for a catastrophic wildfire because of the lack of logging, Gov. Butch Otter told members of Congress on Tuesday. Otter said a disaster along the lines of the devastating 1910 wildfires could be coming, as the trees that came in after those fires are reaching the end of their natural life. That leaves plenty of decaying material on federal lands to burn. ""We've got a devastating fire coming at us ... because of natural death of that forest and its coming at us,"" Otter told a group of sympathetic Republican lawmakers from the West who are members of the Congressional Western Caucus on Capitol Hill. Idaho Republican Rep. Raul Labrador, a member of the caucus, agreed with Otter. ""Eventually it's going to catch fire and it's going to be devastating to Idaho and to the American economy,"" Labrador said. The 1910 fires, also known as the Big Burn, scorched about 3 million acres in Idaho, Montana and Washington. Labrador and Otter want the state to take over management of federal timberlands. But Idaho environmentalists and the timber industry say the federal government is working with them in collaborative efforts to manage Idaho's forests and reduce the fire risk. The Forest Service has recognized that targeted logging near developed areas is helpful, said Bill Higgins, the resource manager of the Idaho Forest Group in Grangeville, one of the larger timber companies in the state. ""We are behind, but we are starting to see a change in course to more active forest management,"" Higgins said Tuesday. Higgins said fire suppression efforts for the past 50 years, as well as lack of thinning from timber harvest, does increase the risk of a big uncontrolled fire. Idaho Conservation League Executive Director Rick Johnson agreed there is a fire risk but said it's a huge oversimplification to suggest logging will fix that. TheWildernessSociety responded to the criticism at Tuesday's caucus hearing by noting the Forest Service last month announced Idaho would receive $5.7 million for three efforts to improve the health of national forests. Johnson criticized Tuesday's event and said cooperative efforts involving the federal government, the timber industry, environmentalists, local officials and others are better than what he called anti-federal ""theater"" and the state trying to manage federal lands. ""The state has different goals, whether it is cutting more trees or providing more jobs or what have you. It's different than the longer-term, bigger, higher-profile goals of the federal government - protecting watersheds, long-term recreation opportunities, wildlife habitat,"" Johnson said. Otter told the Congressional Western Caucus on Tuesday that Idaho is unfairly treated among states because the federal government owns 63 percent of all lands in Idaho and manages nearly three-quarters of the forests. ""I'd hope there would be some discussion of letting the states be the stewards and reap benefits for local schools and communities off those forests,"" Otter said. It's become an issue in the presidential campaign. Republican candidates Rick Santorum and Ron Paul proposed selling or transferring federal lands such as national forests to private interests or to the state. Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney proposed transferring management of national forests to states to increase the revenues they generate.","['respond', 'cauc', 'hear', 'not', 'annount', 'receiv', 'improv', 'johnson', 'crit', 'said', 'involv', 'environ', 'ar', 'cal', 'try', 'man', 'has', 'is', 'cut', 'provid', 'hav', 'protect', 'wildl', 'said']",109,24,['cal'],1,['cut'],1,['cauc'],1,[],0,[],0,"['respond', 'annount', 'crit']",3,"['improv', 'protect']",2,"['respond', 'not', 'annount', 'crit', 'said', 'said']",6,14
13422,2809 words,The Washington Post,A SECTION; Pg. H01; HORIZON,Learn From Nature; A Veteran Ecotourist Picks 10 Favorite Destinations,1995,"Gary Lee, Washington Post Staff Writer  Marveling at Alaska's snow- covered glaciers from the snug seat of a kayak. Staring eye to eye at a howler monkey in the Amazon rain forest. Edging through the Grand Canyon's expanse of burnt orange cliffs on the back of a mule. These are some of the things I've enjoyed over the years in traveling as a foreign correspondent or tourist. Seeking out nature in its varied forms has long been a favorite pastime of mine and one that has proved a powerful learning experience. Today, this latest in travel trends has a name -- ecotourism, which most often refers to trips to environmentally sensitive areas. But as the concept has developed, ecotourism means much more than getting back to nature. For one thing, it also involves giving back to nature. A key component of a good, ecologically oriented vacation, according to most specialists in the field, is making a positive contribution to the chosen destination. That contribution often is financial. Wherever they go, ecotourists are encouraged to funnel travel dollars to support environmental preservation. That can mean buying locally made products or paying extra to stay in solar-powered guest houses. Wise choices in directing this largesse can make ecotourism benefit not only the visitor but also the ecosystem being visited. For example, by showing interest in nature attractions in tropical Belize, visitors have encouraged leaders of that Central American country to invest more in preserving ecologically sensitive areas. Wild lands that might have been bulldozed for ""progress"" now have an economic value that counts in the developing world. The growing popularity of ecotourism is motivating governments and entrepreneurs in many parts of the world to protect natural areas. Ecotravelers also can contribute by helping scientists with research on environmental problems. For example, several groups sponsor environmental science projects that depend on public participation. Boston-based Earthwatch, which organizes environmental research projects worldwide, offers adults the opportunity to do such things as help to study the habitat of the crocodile in South Africa or the possible effects of global warming on Trinidad and Tobago. The NationalWildlifeFederation, one of the country's biggest environmental groups, provides similar opportunities for the younger set. It runs summer workshops in the North Carolina foothills and the Colorado Rockies where participants make field trips through local ecosystems. A well-chosen and planned ecotrip also should give travelers the chance to learn about the ecosystem of their destination. This has long been the goal of the SierraClub, another major environmental organization, which sponsors trips to the Appalachian Mountains and similar nature havens. The objective is to give participants the chance to learn. Though often associated with exotic, remote locales, a satisfying ecotrip can be just around the corner. A day at the ""Amazonia"" exhibit at the National Zoo also constitutes an ecotrip. There you can experience the next best thing to a trip into the Amazon basin and learn in much the same way. Outdoors ecotrips need not cost a life's savings. For little more than the price of a tank of gasoline, Washington-area residents can spend a day at the Canaan Valley National Wildlife Reserve located in Tucker County, W. Va. The latest addition to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's network of nature preserves, this vast expanse of green houses an unusual collection of waterfowl and plant life. Here, in no particular order, are 10 popular ecotourism experiences plus tips about additional information on each. I relate all of these, other than the Madagascar trip, from personal experience. For that one, I have the word of reliable visitors. Hiking the rain forest in Surinam. With more than 250 species of tropical trees and other plants in each square mile, this South American country's rainforest constitutes one of the world's most biologically diverse habitats. In only one day of a week-long visit, I searched for nesting areas of the ""cock of the rock"" and other exotic South American birds, climbed the 750-foot Volzberg peak for a look across hundreds of miles of pristine forest and discovered a group of alligator-like caiman nesting in the Coppename River. Anthropology enthusiasts will find an added attraction -- villages populated by maroons, descendants of slaves who escaped from the former Dutch colonizers in the 1700s. Many villagers maintain the traditional life they followed more than 200 years ago. Guided tours are possible. No rainforest experience is required, but a big bottle of mosquito repellent, sturdy hiking shoes and ability to enjoy rustic accommodations would help to enliven the journey.

If the world's wildlife exotica were a mountain, this island nation off the east coast of Africa would be at the pinnacle. Lemurs -- small monkey-like creatures with oversized ears and winding tails -- run so wild here that they seem to own the place. Cuckoo rollers, false sunbirds and other exotic fowl dominate the skies, and 1,000 species of orchids make the forest a rainbow. The Berenty Reserve, home to 56 rare species of birds and other creatures, is a good place to bask in the splendor of the island's flora and fauna. The Perinet Rainforest station, featuring red and black lemur, among other varieties, also is a popular stop. The island includes dozens of wildlife reserves and two national parks. But Madagascar's charm is that the gamut of rare species, including 120 kinds of birds and at least half a dozen types of forest, are not solely in protected areas. They're within touching distance everywhere, although large areas of virgin forest have long since been cleared. Visiting Madagascar involves a flight not just to Africa but across it and then to the island. It is every bit worth the long trip. With its remaining forests threatened by development, this is clearly a destination that ecotourism dollars can help save. Information: Conservation International, 1015 18th St. NW, Washington, D.C. 20036. Basking in Costa Rica's horn of plenty. This is the favorite destination of nearly every ecotraveler, and for good reason. Located along an isthmus in Central America, it is a magnet for exotic flora and fauna. There are 12,000 species of plants, for example, 350 reptiles and more than 800 kinds of birds. Unlike many tropical countries, Costa Rica packages everything well. Though no bigger than West Virginia, the country includes 45 national parks that protect a gaggle of endangered species, including the green sea turtle and squirrel monkey. Must-see sights include Manuel Antonio National Park, with its iguanas and monkeys, and La Selva Biological Reserve, a bird watcher's paradise. Ecotourism has become a major national industry for Costa Rica, prompting questions about whether successful promotion of its natural wonders has spoiled the country. I think not. Home to 8 percent of the world's flora and fauna, with endless sun and spick-and-span beaches, it is likely to remain a top ecotourism destination for many years.

This 21,000-acre haven for waterfowl is only hours from downtown Washington but seems a world away. Located a few miles from Cambridge, Md., the reserve is a vast, wooded area featuring a sprawling tidal marsh and a sprinkling of freshwater ponds and croplands. The habitat attracts a variety of migratory creatures. For example, blue- and green-winged teal make pit stops here as they journey south in early fall and north in spring. They supplement the towhees, bobwhites, orioles, woodpeckers and others residing year round. My favorite pastime is looking for Delmarva fox squirrels and migrant peregrine falcons, two endangered species that frequent these parts. I glimped the falcons once or twice and the squirrels frequently. The bald eagle, whose status was reclassified last year from endangered to threatened, appears here commonly. The reserve's staff, primarily wildlife specialists, knows how to relay considerable information about the's flora and fauna with a spirit of levity. There is a visitor center, where nature films and lectures occasionally are featured. The reserve is an ideal educational outing, especially for families with teens and other youngsters.

Hiking out of the Nepalese capital Katmandu across Annapurna Range would enthuse even the most jaded traveler. Rhododendrons sprout like dandelions, and kingfishers and flycatchers flap in profusion. But the big hunt, popularized by author Peter Matthiessen, is for a rare glimpse of the snow leopard. A hike through the Annapurna Mountains, where the leopard can be found, is not child's play. If the inclines are not too steep, the trails often are jagged and rough. Fortunately, the locals are only too willing to lug a visitor's heavy goods up and down the hills for a modest fee. Plagued by poverty, Nepal greatly needs ecotourism dollars. An increasing population and poaching of firewood by locals and tourists are taking their toll on the area. Here, a display of sensitivity for protecting the environment can make an impact. Information: Field Studies Council Preston Montford, Montford Bridge Shrewsburg, Shropshire SY4 1HW England. Swimming nose-to-nose with dolphins in Belize. A tropical country in Central America, Belize is a storehouse of exotic creatures. Howler monkeys swing through the woods, manatees cruise the warm waters, endangered hawksbill sea turtles occasionally lumber onto the beaches and needle-legged heron sometimes creep through the forests. But the most enticing of the locals may be the bottlenose dolphins. A sociable lot that seem to enjoy talking and laughing, they make excellent subjects for sea-life watchers. The courageous can do better though because some dolphins are not averse to snuggling close to swimming humans. Returning home from Belize without a greatly enhanced understanding of tropical cultures is difficult. Riverboat tours and guided rainforest expeditions provide many opportunities to learn the ways of the wildlife, the sea life and everything else. All of this is little more than a plane ride or two away, and planning the trip is easily done with a few telephone calls. One could be to Oceanic Society Expeditions, a nonprofit group conducting a long-term study of dolphins on the Turneffe islands a few miles off Belize. The group provides participants the opportunity to help specalists research dolphin habitats and life style.

Sprawling across parts of Maryland and Virgina, the bay is the country's largest estuary. With its fish-filled lagoons, rippling salt marshes, low-lying farmlands and network of rivers and streams, it also is one of America's most varied ecosystems. An adventuresome traveler can do much on his own to explore the region's natural resources, from boating trips out of Cambridge, Md., to hiking trails on the Virginia coast. Several organizations offer the chance to explore various aspects of the bay's natural habitats in depth and to consider strategies to protect it. For example, Earthwatch sponsors one-week study projects in which participants help to conduct research on the habitat of the blue crab, one of the bay's best-known dwellers. From Norfolk, Va., reseachers go by boat offshore to harvest crabs and then return to laboratories to examine the larvae. You pay to do this work, but the price includes food and accommodations. The SierraClub also offers a chance to explore why fish stocks in the bay are being depleted and options for slowing the decline. From a base in Maryland, the trip lasts five days in September.

Kayaking in Glacier Bay, Alaska. Popularized by naturalist John Muir in the 1870s, this national park is sculpted from mountainous, white glaciers and remains as close to heaven as many of us can expect to get. The best vantage point for a panoramic view of the area is from the middle of the blue-green bay waters, and the easiest way to get there is by kayak. From there, one can behold incomparable nature: goats grazing along one hillside, eagles circling another, whales spouting and leaping in the distance, all against a backdrop of towering blocks of ice thousands of years old. One also can hike along the edge of the glaciers and picnic on rocky coves. On a good day, an iceberg might calve from the glacier and tumble into the sea. The starting point for a trip through Glacier Bay is the town of Gustavus. Various agencies can help organize the visit from there. To get the most out of the long trek to Alaska, squeeze in other stops there. Two options include a jaunt through granite fjords in the Tongass National Park and a trip through virgin old-growth forests at Admiralty National Monument. Information: Alaska Division of Tourism.

Though many an enviromentalist has traversed these parts, the Everglades remain impressive and are certain to thrill bird watchers. The Anhinga Trail, an open-air haven near the entrance to the vast glades, offers one of the richest concentrations of exotic waterfowl in the country, and the region is by far the nation's largest sanctuary for tropical wildlife. Anhingas, which swim with only their necks and heads above water, perch in trees and spread their waterlogged wings to dry. Also common are colorful purple gallinules and mangrove cuckoos. The endangered white-crowned pigeons often is seen. The avian spectrum broadens as you push more deeply into the region, and herons, storks, pelicans, ibises and many others birds are commonly seen. Flamingos also are out there, according to the guides, though few claim to have seen one. Alligators roam these parts freely, and the occasional crocodile has been spotted. Best of all, the most popular trails on which to view wildlife are kept trim and clean by Interior Department rangers and are easily accessible. Information: Everglades National Park, 400001 State Road 9336, Homestead, Fla., 33034-6733. 305-242-7700. Walking on water at Lake Baikal in Siberia. In half a dozen trips to the world's deepest freshwater lake, I have come to think of it as one of the most majestic of Earth's natural wonders. I have experienced it from many perspectives. One February morning, I hiked onto the frozen surface and delightedly gazed through the ice to see fish circling beneath. Seven months later, I returned, cruising the lake's circumference in a trawler converted into a tourist boat. During another trip, I hiked for two days around the's rocky edge, and later I stared at the lake for hours from a hotel room near the shore. Though the fish and water quality of this sprawling body of water have long been threatened by chemicals and other pollution, it retains great charm. On a continent of natural wonders, including a vast coniferous forest, this probably is the most attractive. Getting there from Washington requires a flight to Moscow and another to Irkutsk in western Siberia. For the adventuresome, several local groups can help make arrangements. So can various travel agencies. Information: Russian National Tourist Office, 800 Third Ave., Suite 3101, New York, N.Y. 10022. 212-758-1162.

146275,1594 words,Contra Costa Times (California),BUSINESS,Huge solar power plants are blooming in California's southern deserts,2011,"MOJAVE DESERT -- At first glance, California's vast Mojave Desert seems barren: mile after mile of dust, sand and scrubby creosote bush under a blistering sun. But the huge desert, which spans an area larger than West Virginia, is becoming speckled with gigantic solar power plants that are creating hundreds of construction jobs and, when complete, will generate electricity for millions of homes. California's solar Gold Rush is under way, fueled by billions of dollars of federal stimulus funding and a new state law that requires utilities to buy a third of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020. While the collapse of Fremont solar manufacturer Solyndra has dominated the news in recent weeks because it received a $535 million loan guarantee from the Department of Energy, several other solar companies that received loan guarantees appear to be thriving. The project furthest along is BrightSource Energy's Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, which has been under construction for one full year and is currently being built on federal land near the California-Nevada border with the help of a $1.6 billion loan guarantee. BrightSource, which is based in Oakland, uses mirrors to concentrate the sun and turn turbines that generate electricity. When complete in 2013, Ivanpah will be the largest solar thermal power plant in the world, generating enough electricity for 140,000 homes. Currently, more than 800 construction workers are on the sprawling 3,600-acre site, which covers an area half the size of Los Gatos. The steel shell of a massive tower that eventually will be taller than coastal redwood trees is rising from the dust near a parking lot filled with cars, trucks and construction vehicles. Most of the workers arrive before dawn to beat the searing late-afternoon heat, and engineering managers pore over plans in air-conditioned trailers. Ivanpah is one of nine solar thermal power plants approved by the California Energy Commission last year. In addition, scores of other solar projects are in the pipeline. In August, the federal Bureau of Land Management was processing applications for 17 solar power plants in California's deserts. Solar currently accounts for less than 1 percent of the state's electricity, most of which comes from natural gas, two nuclear power plants and hydropower. But advocates -- including Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown -- want solar to play a key role in the state's energy future, in part because each project generates hundreds of construction jobs. Brown hopes to add 20,000 megawatts of renewable generation -- about one-third of the state's current power needs -- to California's electric grid by the end of the decade. ""We use a lot of energy in California, and we have aspirations to electrify our vehicle fleet, our ports and to develop high-speed rail,"" said Commissioner Karen Douglas of the California Energy Commission. ""We need significant amounts of utility-scale renewable electricity."" Public land at risk? However, critics and grass-roots organizations such as Solar Done Right fear the West's last remaining tracts of pristine public lands are being industrialized by ""Big Solar"" in the name of clean energy, bringing irreparable harm to native plants and threatened species. They want ""smart from the start"" planning that allows renewable energy development in some parts of the desert while protecting the rest as conservation land. They want residents in the Bay Area and elsewhere to know that California's deserts are as beloved to some residents as its beaches, parks and redwood trees are to others. ""There's plenty of desert out there -- just put it in the right place,"" said Jim Lyons, senior director for renewable energy at DefendersofWildlife, a national organization that opposes the proposed 4,613-acre Calico Solar Project east of Barstow because of its effects on desert tortoises, burrowing owls and bighorn sheep. ""It's a lot like real estate: location, location, location."" Solar's potential The Ivanpah facility embodies many of the hopes and fears of solar power plants in the desert. It will generate 370 megawatts of electricity, which BrightSource says will displace 13.5 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions over the plant's 30-year life. Google ( GOOG ) has invested $168 million in the project, while PG&E and Southern California Edison have signed long-term contracts to purchase the electricity. ""Solar thermal technology projects like Ivanpah are playing a vital role in helping us meet our state renewable goals while providing for a secure and sustainable energy future,"" Fong Wan, senior vice president for energy procurement at PG&E, said in a statement. Unlike rooftop solar panels that directly convert sunlight into electricity, solar thermal plants concentrate the sun's rays with mirrors or lenses to boil water to create steam; the steam then turns turbines that generate electricity. Ivanpah consists of three separate power plants, each with a 459-foot-tall ""power tower"" and tens of thousands of mirrorlike ""heliostats"" -- 173,500 in all. While land has been cleared for the construction site, BrightSource has taken pains to leave much of the native vegetation intact. Thousands of pylons protrude from the ground amid vegetation that has been trimmed, but not plowed. ""This has the lowest environmental impact of any project in solar,"" BrightSource CEO John Woolard said in remarks to media members who toured the project. ""We're using a minimal amount of water, and there is low impact on the soil and terrain."" But Jim Andre, a botanist and plant ecologist at UC Riverside, says native plants will not survive under the newly created shade. ""You're altering the conditions that the species have evolved in,"" he said. ""It goes against conservation biology 101."" Concern about tortoise The biggest environmental controversy at Ivanpah is the endangered desert tortoise. Though BrightSource expects to spend at least $45 million on everything from salaries for biologists to the purchase of thousands of acres of conservation habitat, activists worried about the tortoise protested outside the company's Oakland headquarters. While alienating some environmentalists, Big Solar has many supporters among the ranks of the state's unemployed. Ivanpah is a welcome source of jobs in San Bernardino County, which has been hit hard by the housing crash. Iraq War veterans Ross Bowlin and Kenneth Platten carpool more than 200 miles from their homes near Riverside to get to Ivanpah, and they share an inexpensive hotel room in Nevada during the workweek. Both obtained their jobs via ""Helmets to Hardhats,"" an apprentice program that helps veterans transition to careers in the construction trades. ""Before this job I had no construction experience at all, and I was on unemployment for a while,"" said Bowlin, a former Marine who served two stints in Iraq. ""But this job reminds me of being in the military, in that we have a job that's bigger than ourselves. We're facing an energy crisis."" Platten, who served in the Army, misses the adrenaline rush of war but says the sheer scale of Ivanpah gives him a different kind of thrill. The good wages -- about $35 an hour -- help make up for the long drive. In addition, he's used to the desert heat: The deserts of Iraq are even hotter than the Mojave. ""We're building the biggest solar thermal power plant in the world,"" he said, as he surveyed the power tower. ""To see this going up is amazing. I can look out and know that I hauled some of that iron, and that's cool."" Sprouting like weeds Ivanpah is not BrightSource's only project. The company has filed applications with the California Energy Commission to build two other large solar power plants: the 500-megawatt Hidden Hills project, in California's Inyo County, and the 750-megawatt Rio Mesa project in Riverside County. ""There's so many companies submitting plans and filing for permits that it's hard to keep track,"" said Laura Cunningham of Basin and Range Watch, a volunteer group fighting ""energy sprawl."" ""You basically have a few dozen activists trying to protect this huge desert,"" she said. ""Each solar project is on a different type of ecosystem, and there hasn't been a lot of planning. It's been, 'There's sun, let's build a power plant.' "" Cunningham grew up in the Bay Area and moved to a rural mining town in southern Nevada 10 years ago. A biologist and reptile expert, she has grown to love the desert, and the sense of calm and wonder it inspires. ""You can go into the desert and feel like you are the only person in the world,"" she said. ""And yet it's teeming with life: jack rabbits, burrowing owls, rattlesnakes. In the spring, we have the most spectacular wildflowers, and the whole desert erupts in blossoms."" Conservation plan In an effort to resolve conflicts between solar companies and conservationists, California is developing a Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan to decide which parts of the desert will be open for renewable energy development and which parts will be protected. ""Initially, all of these big solar projects were being crammed down our throats,"" said Ileene Anderson, a biologist with the Center for Biological Diversity who is active in the conservation plan's process. ""But now the state is realizing that you can't just bully projects into being -- you have to take a close look at where they are sited. Climate change is real, and we have to transition to renewable energy. But let's do it without driving species to extinction."" Contact Dana Hull at 408-920-2706.

59651,1266 words,The New York Times,Section B; Page 1; Column 2; Metropolitan Desk,Connecticut Confronts Being Its Own Nuclear Waste Site,1991,"If geologists were to devise a hypothetical worst state in which to build a nuclear waste dump, it would probably be very much like Connecticut. This state has steep, rocky granite hills and high water tables, which are unsuitable for placing such a dump, and it is one of the most crowded states in the nation. But with four commercial nuclear reactors, a reactor owned by the Navy, a nuclear fuel manufacturer and a base where nuclear submarines are built, this 4,844-square-mile state is one of the major producers of radioactive waste. No other state wants that waste. And under a Federal law that takes effect on Jan. 1, 1993, no other state will have to take it unless it wants to. The state has sent mixed signals about what it wants to do between now and that cutoff date, with one hand pushing construction of a dump and the other supporting the effort to block it while seeking an alternative. The resulting concentration of Federal law, nature, history and ambivalent public policy are all set to collide in Sanford Cohen's pumpkin field over the next few years. Mr. Cohen, whose family has farmed this land in Ellington since 1915, sits near the nexus of three sites the state identified earlier this year in a study of possible places to put concrete bunkers to store low-level nuclear waste, like contaminated gloves, boots, air filters and biomedical research materials. Residents near the sites -- two in Ellington and one in East Windsor, about 20 miles northeast of Hartford -- immediately rose up in protest, with many embarking on a crash course in nuclear technology and grass-roots organizing. State officials say that a nuclear waste dump is urgently needed here because South Carolina, which now accepts most of Connecticut's low-level nuclear waste, will close its borders to out-of-state shippers in 16 months. South Carolina can close its borders earlier if its officials are not convinced that Connecticut is trying to solve its nuclear waste disposal problems. A dump here could not open until at least the mid-90's. Waste producers have already been told that they will have to store radioactive materials from 1993 until the dump can open. Residents of Ellington, a town of 12,000, say that the state rushed its study and that it has unnecessarily focused on an overcrowded area known as the Great Marsh in colonial days. About 75,000 people live within five miles of the three sites, according to town estimates, and there are four public schools within two miles. Fewer People Near Other Sites By contrast, California, which is close to building a low-level nuclear waste dump, has proposed a site that is 23 miles from the nearest community, Needles, a town of 5,000 people in a desert near the California-Nevada border. Nebraska and Illinois have also proposed sites in sparsely populated areas. New York is several years behind Connecticut in selecting a site and New Jersey is scheduled to announce possible sites next year. ""They didn't know what they were doing when they plunked it down here,"" said Ellington's top elected official, First Selectman Donald V. Landmann. ""There are just too many people."" Mr. Cohen, who grew up on one of the proposed sites, said: ""There's too much water. You get a leak and it's going straight into the water supply."" Months after the proposed sites were announced, the State Legislature appropriated $300,000 to residents here to help them fight the state proposal. And the authority that selected the sites said this month that errors in the selection would require a full review that would delay the project at least six months. State officials have yet to set foot on any of the proposed sites, or test the stability or suitability of the sandstone soil formation. Connecticut is also searching for an out-of-state partner to take its waste, while the State Attorney General's office said last month that it would join a suit that seeks to overturn the Federal law. 3 States May Bar Connecticut Nonetheless, Connecticut officials say they are serious about building the dump. South Carolina, Nevada and Washington, the three states that now accept low-level waste, have all threatened to stop taking waste from Connecticut and several other states if efforts to build local dumps are dragged out or are not being made in good faith. One state, Michigan, has already been forced to store its waste near its nuclear plants. ""It's a balancing act,"" said Joseph M. Cohen, a spokesman for the Connecticut Hazardous Waste Management Service, which oversees the site selection. ""You have to balance public health and safety without risking it one iota against the need to site the facility in Connecticut."" Mr. Cohen, who is no relation to Sanford Cohen, the farmer, added that the state's population density and other problems make it ""one of the toughest areas in the nation to build a waste facility."" But because Connecticut has no choice, he said, it must simply proceed as best it can. He stressed that safety could still be guaranteed. But whether this community ends up as victor or vanquished in Connecticut's waste wars, state and local officials agree that the era of innocence about the state's nuclear dependence is gone forever, which could have implications on the state's future energy policy. Sharon Schall, a social worker who helped found Citizens Opposed to a Radioactive Environment this summer, said she knew little about Connecticut's use of nuclear energy a few months ago. But she is learning. ""We have a legal committee,"" she said, ""a technical committee, a public awareness committee, a financial committee, and we have people doing research into the geology."" Connecticut derives 50 percent or more of its electrical power grid from nuclear generation, one of only six states that does so, according to the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The others are Maine, Vermont, New Jersey, Illinois and South Carolina. The national average is 19 percent. That dependence produces a waste stream that in 1989 totaled 49,000 cubic feet of low-level waste that was shipped out of state, according to the most recent figures from the Federal Department of Energy. That averaged out to about 10 cubic feet of waste per square mile, compared with about 7 cubic feet per square mile in New Jersey and 2 in New York. Although some other states produced more waste, all had more room to store it as well, and in most cases lower population densities to work around. Waste Has to Go Somewhere But another dawning reality is that the waste, ignored for so many years, has to go somewhere. Lawyers representing Ellington and East Windsor say they will argue that the nuclear power plants themselves are the best sites for long-term storage. But Mr. Cohen at the Waste Management Service said that geology once again rules that out. Power plants must be sited on bedrock, he said, while dumps cannot be because a water leak into porous bedrock would be untraceable. That would not be a problem in the sandstone formation they believe exists around Ellington, he said. Environmentalists say that keeping nuclear waste in the state where it was produced is probably more fair, but they agree that it is a harsh sort of justice. ""It is a very healthy principle that those who benefit from a technology should pay the full costs,"" said Fred Millar, director of the toxics project at FriendsoftheEarth, a Washington-based environmental group. ""But if those costs are factored in it turns out its damn more expensive than it was sold to be.""  LOAD-DATE: September 16, 1991 Graph/Diagram: ""Connecticut's Nuclear Rubish"" Connecticut shipped 49,091.5 cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste to disposal sites out of state in 1989, enough to make a cube 36 feet, 7 inches on a side. Here are the kinds of waste that made up that total, shown in proportional cubes. Combustible or compactable trash: 23,950 cu. ft. Mainly protective clothing, rags, gloves, plastics and air filters, small metal and glass items, construction materials and packaging waste. Noncumbustible, noncompactable trash: 8,655 cu. ft.

31078,818 words,Saint Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota),MAIN; Pg. 1A,WISCONSIN GOVERNOR PICKED FOR CABINET; THOMPSON WILL HEAD HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT,2000,"Rushing to flesh out his government before the new year, President-elect George W. Bush named four more choices for his Cabinet on Friday. Bush named Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson secretary of health and human services, former Colorado Attorney General Gale Norton secretary of the interior, Houston school Superintendent Rod Paige secretary of education and decorated Vietnam War veteran Anthony Principi secretary of veterans affairs. His choices pleased conservatives but angered liberals, who complained that Thompson might push restrictions on abortion rights and Norton might roll back restraints on the use of public lands. Norton is allied with James Watt, the controversial interior secretary under President Ronald Reagan. Bush has named 12 Cabinet members in the two weeks since he secured his election victory, leaving energy, labor and transportation yet to be filled, perhaps next week. Spokesman Ari Fleischer called it a ""sign of a decisive leader who knows what he wants."" Bush turned to Thompson to head HHS, the sprawling department that oversees the Head Start nutrition program, Medicare, Medicaid, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the surgeon general. ""He's a leader and innovator,"" Bush said. An architect of welfare overhaul in his four terms as Wisconsin's governor, Thompson is likely to spearhead Bush's efforts to change Medicare and to add a benefit to help seniors pay for prescription drugs. Thompson said he also will play a role in efforts to change Social Security. Thompson sidestepped questions about his opposition to abortion, saying only that he proved his willingness to listen to all sides of the issue when he served as chairman of the Republican Party's platform committee last summer. Yet even while changing some party positions on other controversial issues, Thompson's platform left the party's language on abortion intact from previous years. It called for a constitutional amendment to ban abortion and recommended that a Republican president consider abortion when picking federal judges. Bush himself favors allowing abortion in cases of rape or incest or to save the woman's life. Abortion rights groups vowed to oppose Thompson's confirmation. ""President Bush has chosen one of this nation's staunchest opponents of a woman's right to choose to head the agency with the greatest impact on women's health,"" said Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. Bush's interior secretary choice also is likely to inspire opposition. As the steward of the nation's public lands, much of them in the West, Norton will be responsible for pursuing Bush's campaign promise to consider opening a small part of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. Bush called Norton ""a leader who will respect the land and honor our national commitment to conservation"" but also said she will ""find ways to develop our nation's resources in a balanced and an environmentally friendly way."" As Colorado's attorney general, Norton won a court victory pressuring the federal government to clean up hazardous wastes at the Rocky Flats nuclear storage site and the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, and chaired the Environment Committee for the National Association of Attorneys General. She also is a protege of Watt, having worked for him at the Mountain States Legal Foundation and the Interior Department. Watt was an advocate of opening federal land to exploration and development, and environmental groups opposed him intensely. ""If you pick a protege of James Watt ... that's going to scare you to death,"" said Rodger Schlickeisen, president of the DefendersofWildlife environmentalist group. For education, Bush tapped an educator familiar to him but unknown outside Texas. In Houston, test scores have improved during the six years Paige has been superintendent, and he has been credited with transforming the nation's seventh-largest school district into one of its best. Paige will be responsible for leading Bush's efforts to revitalize public schools by setting national standards and offering parents help in taking their children out of failing public schools. He is the second black named to Bush's Cabinet; Secretary of State-designate Colin Powell was the first. For Veterans Affairs, Bush tapped Principi of Rancho Santa Fe, Calif. The head of QTC Medical Services, Principi is a Navy veteran who has served as chief counsel for the Senate Committees on Armed Services and Veterans Affairs, as deputy secretary of veterans affairs and as acting secretary of veterans affairs under former President George Bush. As the chief advocate for 27 million veterans, Principi will be responsible for carrying out Bush's promise to modernize the veterans' health care system.","['pick', 'going', 'scar', 'said', 'tap', 'hav', 'improv', 'has', 'been', 'has', 'been', 'credit', 'transform', 'seventhlargest', 'be', 'lead', 'revit', 'set', 'off', 'tak', 'fail']",98,21,[],0,['scar'],1,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,['improv'],1,['said'],1,3
164642,367 words,San Jose Mercury News (California),LOCAL; Pg. 1B,"MAN RAN PUPPY MILL ON RANCH, OFFICIALS SAY 130 DOGS FOUND",2001,"San Benito County animal-control authorities seized more than 130 dogs from what authorities say was an illegal puppy mill at an isolated ranch southwest of San Juan Bautista. The animals -- cairn and Scottish terriers, Australian cattle dogs, Great Pyrenees, border collies, Pomeranians and poodles -- were living in deplorable conditions, said Hollister animal-control officer Julie Carreiro. Carreiro expects to file animal-cruelty charges against Kenneth Hershey, who leases the property at the 311-acre Hershey Ranch on Salinas Grade Road. Hershey wasn't available for comment. The raid, which started Wednesday and ended Thursday, followed a monthslong investigation. Hershey had been breeding and selling dogs for about five years, said county code enforcement officer Stacy Turner. The dogs lived in makeshift quarters and pet carriers, she said. Hershey also lacked a use permit, Turner said. Such a permit is required for keeping more than eight dogs. The permit prescribes standards for hygiene, nutrition and living conditions. An annual inspection by county authorities also is required. Animal-control officers from the HumaneSociety of the United States, HumaneSociety of the Santa Clara Valley, the Monterey County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and animal-control officers from Monterey and Salinas were recruited to help local rescuers. Authorities say sparsely populated San Benito County lends its self to clandestine operations. In September 1987, a woman was charged with animal cruelty after authorities found 279 dogs, 66 cats, 10 chickens, two ponies and a sheep at an isolated kennel on 70 acres near highways 101 and 156 north of San Juan Bautista. A veterinarian and county animal-control officials said the animals appeared relatively well-fed, but living in squalor in cramped quarters. Elizabeth Blodgett had obtained a use permit for a 300-dog kennel but left the structure half-finished. She was ordered to get rid of most of the animals, and later reached an out-of-court settlement that included ano-contest plea to illegally and improperly housing and exercising animals. Animal-cruelty charges were dropped.","['wer', 'recruit', 'help', 'say', 'lend', 'clandestin', 'was', 'charg', 'found', 'said', 'appear', 'liv']",112,12,[],0,[],0,[],0,['charg'],1,['lend'],1,[],0,['lend'],1,"['say', 'said']",2,5
38044,980 Words,Automotive News,NA,"Are greenfield factories really green?; New plants reduce lands for crops, wildlife, critics say",2008,"In a few weeks, Civic sedans will start rolling off the line at Honda Motor Co.'s new assembly plant near Greensburg, Ind. Less than two years ago, the site was green with crops of corn and beans. The dramatic transformation of 1,700 acres of fertile Midwest farmland into an industrial complex came with barely a whiff of public protest, says John Richards, a commissioner of Decatur County, Ind. The county is home to about 25,000 people -- and now Honda Manufacturing of Indiana. Most people thought that ``what everybody was going to benefit far outweighed what they were going to lose,'' Richards said in a telephone interview. But environmental and farmland preservation groups, among others, tell Automotive News that the calculation, while understandable, is shortsighted and unwise. They say that automakers' site selection decisions often contribute to the sprawl that is gobbling up irreplaceable green spaces. These are places that produce food, harbor wildlife and offset the emissions from human activities that cause global warming. Land misuse policies The criticism hits hardest at import brand automakers, which have built nearly all the new plants during the past 25 years. Most were on greenfield sites in Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Alabama, South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia and Texas. General Motors contributed to the trend with its Saturn plant in Tennessee and Lansing Delta plant in Michigan. Ironically, the same import-brand automakers that have been spreading plants across rural and small-town areas have been widely credited with building fuel-efficient vehicles and developing environmentally sensitive production processes and facilities. Take Toyota Motor Corp. It gets kudos from consumers for its high-mileage Prius sedan. But in the past quarter century, Toyota has poured more concrete over more farmland to build on more greenfield sites than any other automaker -- 12 of them. In the Greensburg case, Honda took great care to replant extensive areas and provide a series of lakes for natural management of surface water, spokesman Andrew Stoner says. But the automakers' original site selection decisions ``call into question the green claims of their facilities,'' says Trip Pollard, director of the land and communities program at the SouthernEnvironmentalLawCenter. The nonprofit group normally doesn't fight individual projects, such as assembly plants, but it tries to change the public policies that encourage unwise land use, Pollard says. State governments compete vigorously for automobile plants. They then typically subsidize the new plants with tax breaks and other incentives, including upgraded or expanded rail lines and highways. The additions also encourage suppliers to locate nearby and help workers commute -- generally one person per vehicle -- to new factory jobs. So the sprawl effect is compounded, critics say. ``There's a whole nest of issues,'' Pollard says. Kim Hill, associate director of the economics and business group at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich., labels incentives for greenfield sites ``kind of absurd'' and the sprawling development they promote ``unsustainable.'' Better brown? Hill says essential infrastructure components such as highways, rail lines, utilities and sewer plants are already in place around many abandoned industrial sites, known as brownfields. Governments could attract new plants to brownfields if they had them prepared for redevelopment when site selection decisions are made and if they indemnified new owners for any on-site contamination that is uncovered, he says. ``I'm a big proponent of reusing the land.'' Of course, factors beyond land use are involved in site selection. Import-brand automakers try to mold their own work forces and avoid ``contamination'' from people who previously worked in other, unionized factories, Hill says. ``It's unfair,'' he contends. For now, the attraction between nonurban areas and automakers is going to be difficult to break, says Bob Wagner, managing director of programs for the American Farmland Trust, a preservation group. For many economically struggling communities surrounded by open spaces, ``the loss of farmland is not an immediate or acute issue,'' he says. But the organization says that cropland is not as plentiful as it seems. Only about 3 percent of the Earth's surface remains good for growing food. In the United States, more than 1 million acres are lost to development every year. Ann Sorensen, the Farmland Trust's assistant vice president for research, says the promise of good jobs trumps concern for farmland, but the fight against global warming may alter the debate. ``Land use arguments are going to change dramatically because of climate change,'' Sorensen says. LEEDing location Already, there are signs that it is occurring. Automakers, suppliers and dealers all boast when they get LEED certification for their facilities. The name stands for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, a program of the U.S. Green Building Council. The program measures and certifies buildings for their environmental friendliness. The next generation of LEED standards will include a measurement of the efficiency of a building's location, Deron Lovaas tells Automotive News. He is vehicles campaign director for the NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncil, an environmental group. But such considerations will come too late for too much land, says Charles Connall, a trustee of Adams Township in Decatur County, Ind. Some of Honda's land is in the township. Connall, a former farmer and livestock feed salesman who now works at Wal-Mart, says he didn't publicly object to Honda's arrival because the site was not his land. But he says he hates to see farmland turned into ``cement and pavement.'' ``We're going to see the time when we are begging for food,'' he says. ``We're seeing it already.''","['cal', 'say', 'doesnt', 'tri', 'chang', 'enco', 'say', 'compet', 'subsid', 'includ', 'upgrad', 'expand', 'is', 'com', 'say', 'charl', 'connal', 'is', 'connal', 'work', 'say', 'didnt', 'honda', 'was']",154,24,['cal'],1,[],0,['upgrad'],1,[],0,"['subsid', 'upgrad']",2,[],0,[],0,"['say', 'say', 'com', 'say', 'say']",5,9
98115,610 words,The Santa Fe New Mexican (New Mexico),EDITORIALS; Pg. A-7,"THEIR VIEW: 'PEACE IN THE FOREST' UNSETTLING, UNTRUE",2006,"We were very disturbed by Peter Friederici's article ""Peace in the Forest"" in the Nov. 16 Outdoors section. Its misconceptions, half-truths, conspicuous omissions, and outright lies are a slap in the face to all of us who were involved in trying to revitalize community forestry during the 1990s. Friederici fails to provide any of the historical and cultural context necessary to understand a very complex and important period that not only affected Northern New Mexico forestry but also raised questions all over the country about the relationships between environmentalists, funders, indigenous communities, and the Forest Service. Friederici's spin -- that environmental groups like Forest Guardians ""who drove the nail into the coffin of New Mexico's 400-year-old logging economy"" and are now responsible for ""bringing it back to life"" --- is a distortion of the role they really played. Forest Guardians indeed ""drove the nail into the coffin"" by repeatedly appealing and litigating timber sales in the Vallecitos Sustained Yield Unit -- an approximately 75,000-acre area whose resources were set aside by Congress to benefit the members of the isolated and impoverished communities surrounding it -- as part of its ""Zero Cut"" agenda. Moreover, Bryan Bird, as a member of the statewide governing board of the SierraClub, censured the comments of the northern group of the SierraClub supporting the Agua Caballos timber sale in the Unit and stifled all debate on the issue within the Club. The result, however, was not a rebirth but the death of local community forestry businesses that had fought the Forest Service to establish sustainable yields within the Unit long before the arrival of Forest Guardians. Friederici's self-contradictory evaluation of the Forest Service Collaborative Forest Restoration Project extols the relationship between Forest Guardians, the community, and CFRP coordinator Walter Dunn, while at the same time reluctantly acknowledging that little on-the-ground restoration work has actually been accomplished. The real issue, which Friederici fails to address, is that government-subsidized thinning has not created economic development or built community capacity. Groups like Forest Guardians and ForestGuild, which administer CFRP grants for community members like Alfonso Chacon, take a significant cut of the money, but the program typically fails to establish sustainable businesses. This letter only touches the surface of what needs to be addressed in Friederici's article. As editors of Northern New Mexico's La Jicarita News we have written a fully detailed response in our November issue (www.lajicarita.org) with commentary by many important stakeholders who Friederici failed to interview in his piece. We also cited important academic studies that help us understand the issues of race and class engendered by the battles that took place in Northern New Mexico, including Carl Wilmsen's and David Correia's dissertations on the Vallecitos Sustained Yield Unit and Jake Kosek's book, Understories, The Political Life of Forests in Northern New Mexico. For the record, however, we can't let several of Bryan Bird's comments go unchallenged in this letter. Environmentalists Sam Hitt and John Talberth's wives were never hung in effigy, even though Charlotte Talberth also was a Forest Guardian activist involved in the timber sale appeals and lawsuits. Furthermore, his comment that loggers cut down several big pines ""just to spite us"" and that ""everybody has taken a deep breath and stood down"" are self-serving and unsubstantiated.

23053,559 words,St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota),MINNESOTA-TWIN CITIES; News; National; State,Lawsuit challenges Minnesota oil pipeline,2014,"Environmental groups on Wednesday filed a legal challenge to the U.S. State Department's approval of a major increase of Canadian tar sands oil flowing through Enbridge Energy pipelines into the U.S. The groups, joined by the White Earth Ojibwe Nation, filed suit in federal district court in Minneapolis, alleging federal officials acted illegally and in collusion with pipeline industry executives when they approved a major expansion of oil moving across the border. The State Department recently signed off on a plan by Enbridge to use the Canadian portion of the Alberta Clipper line to move oil south, transfer the oil to another, parallel pipeline -- called Line 3 -- for the actual border crossing, then transfer it back into Alberta Clipper once the oil is in the U.S. The plan will add an extra 350,000 barrels, or 14.7 million gallons, per day to the Alberta Clipper capacity and is considered a temporary move until the increased flow is approved to cross the border. The State Department must approve all cross-border pipelines. But Enbridge claims, and the State Department so far has agreed, that Enbridge's proposed back-and-forth transfer avoids the need for new State Department approval of the border crossing because the 1968-vintage Line 3 already is permitted by the government. ""The approval this summer happened without public notice and without a legally required review that's meant to protect air, water, wildlife and public health,"" the groups said Wednesday. The ""scheme'' to move the oil back and forth between lines ""is a blatant attempt to bypass"" federal environmental regulations, said Michael Brune, executive director of the SierraClub. Environmental groups said they have obtained documents that show collusion between State Department officials and Enbridge in allowing the transfer between pipelines. ""What's happening here is extraordinarily illegal,"" said Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity. Enbridge officials on Wednesday said the pipeline transfer is legal and proper. ""Enbridge believes that the State Department has acted lawfully in connection with its presidential permitting responsibilities,"" said Enbridge spokeswoman Lorraine Little. ""We constructed interconnections between the existing Line 67 and Line 3 pipelines in both Canada and the U.S. to allow us to meet customer demands in the short term using existing permitted cross-border capacity while the Line 67 presidential permit amendment application remains pending before the State Department."" A State Department spokesman could not be reached Wednesday afternoon. The State Department, meanwhile, is considering a major expansion for the Alberta Clipper pipeline that will bring more so-called tar sands oil 1,000 miles from northern Canada into the U.S., across 285 miles of northern Minnesota to Superior, Wis.. The Alberta Clipper line was completed in 2010. The 36-inch diameter line was designed to be expanded by adding pumping stations, a move that could nearly double capacity to 800,000 barrels, or 3.6 million gallons per day. Now, Enbridge is ready for that expansion. It's not clear when the State Department will act on the original Alberta Clipper crossing permit. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission already has approved an increase in pumping capacity of the Alberta Clipper line within the state.","['mov', 'is', 'bypass', 'said', 'said', 'hav', 'obtain', 'show', 'allow', 'hap', 'is', 'said', 'said', 'is']",79,14,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,"['said', 'said', 'said', 'said']",4,4

A near-unanimous chorus of scientists across the globe is warning that if we want to leave an inhabitable planet to future generations, we need to begin a quick shift toward less polluting energy sources. But there's more in the forecast than just doom and gloom. The most hopeful signs are to be seen in the efforts of states and cities to adopt their own global warming plans. For example, California's Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has set a goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, and is working to adopt policies required to meet this goal. New Mexico is following suit. Ten states have adopted global warming pollution limits for automobiles. Eight states have set emission caps for their electric power industry to reduce by 10 percent by 2019. Many of the clean-energy policies that reduce global warming pollution also provide economic and quality-of-life benefits such as reduced energy bills, green space preservation, air quality improvements, reduced traffic congestion, improved transportation choices, and economic development and job creation through energy conservation and new energy technologies. In other words, a lot of the things we can do to stop global warming we should be doing anyway for economic, national security and environmental benefits. Illinois should join the states that are acting now, with concrete, achievable steps that will put our economy on better footing when the United States inevitably joins the rest of the industrialized world in adopting limits on global warming emissions. EnvironmentIllinois is asking state legislators to pledge support for a plan to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions by 10 percent in the next 10 years. This is just a start, but that's exactly what we need right now. Rebecca Stanfield, Director EnvironmentIllinois Chicago Thanks for a great Blooming Fest Another wonderful Blooming Fest in West Chicago has come and gone, but the sweet ""smell"" of success, like the dozens of varieties of flowering plants and shrubs that were for sale, will linger long into the coming months. That's because hundreds of people in and around West Chicago discovered just what the downtown community has to offer through a homegrown event that celebrated its sixth year, thanks to the dedication and commitment of many residents and volunteers. The city of West Chicago would like to thank its community partners for helping to make Blooming Fest '06 such a rousing success: the West Chicago Garden Club, Ball Horticultural Company, Wheaton Academy, School District 33, West Chicago High School Key Club, SCARCE, University of Illinois-Cooperative Extension, Service Master Gardeners, Friends of the Museum, Cultural Arts Commission, West Chicago Park District, West Chicago Public Library, West Chicago Police Department, the Wayne and Helen Fox Community Center, St. Mary's Church, The Franz Girls, Frank's Automotive, Amity Masonic Lodge 472, St. Michael's United Church of Christ, West Chicago Bible Church and the many volunteers who donated their time and talent. Between those that ran or walked in the Perennial 5k or 2K for the benefit of We Grow Dreams - a not for profit organization created for people with disabilities - and those that came out to support the West Chicago Garden Club's Plant Sale, downtown West Chicago was blooming with community pride and spirit. As attendance for Blooming Fest steadily grows, so does awareness and appreciation for West Chicago's many downtown assets: great restaurants, unique retailers, customer-focused service businesses, dynamic City Museum, and show-stopping fountain. We thank the community for carving out a little part of your busy weekend to join us this year at Blooming Fest, and we hope you become a frequent visitor to downtown West Chicago!

The Utah Division of Wildlife Resources (DWR) is offering an opportunity to see as many as 20,000 in one day. The state wildlife agency is holding its annual Snow Goose Day viewing event during the Delta Snow Goose Festival on Feb. 21 and 22. Each spring as many as 20,000 snow geese and Ross' geese fly through Utah on their migratory flights north. The waterfowl stop at Gunnison Bend Reservoir for a break, providing excellent viewing opportunities. The event is free and a fun, family-friendly event. ""We'll provide spotting scopes so you can get a close look at the geese,"" said Bob Walters, DWR's WatchableWildlife coordinator. ""We'll also be available to answer any questions you have."" The geese are found feeding in fields near the reservoir in the mornings and then lift off en masse, usually between 9 a.m. and 10:30 a.m. The geese typically spend the day on the reservoir and then head back to the fields between 4 and 6 p.m. State wildlife biologists will be on hand at the festival to help people find the birds if they are on the fields. People with binoculars or spotting scopes should bring them to the event, but there will be some available for the public to use.

58412,921 words,Distributed by McClatchy-Tribune Business News,STATE AND REGIONAL NEWS,Fort Bragg expects to stop using goats for trauma training as military moves to ban it,2013,"Jan. 13--On average, soldiers on Fort Bragg slaughter 300 goats a month for medical trauma training meant to help save lives in battle. Animal activists say the animals are shot, stabbed, bludgeoned and blown up to simulate the types of injuries soldiers face. For three decades, the activists have tried to end the practice. Their efforts appear to have finally paid off. The 2013 National Defense Authorization Act, signed into law this month, requires the Department of Defense to provide Congress with a strategy and detailed timeline by March for the replacement of animals for medical training. PeoplefortheEthicalTreatmentofAnimals, which applauds the move, said Fort Bragg training accounts for about a third of the animal deaths caused by the military each year. Government documents show that officials at Fort Bragg's Army Special Operations Command solicited up to 3,600 goats for use in training last year. The documents show that the command planned to use about 300 goats a month. Officials with the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School and Army Special Operations Command confirmed that they use animals for training but said they could not comment further. The officials said they have not been given specific guidance on the requirements outlined by the authorization act. PETA and other groups have protested the use of live animals in military training, advocating for simulation and other modern, nonanimal methods, said Justin Goodman, director of the group's Laboratory Investigations Department. In the 1980s, advocates were able to stop the use of dogs and cats in the training, Goodman said, but the language in the authorization act represents the first time Congress has required the military to formalize its efforts to end all animal use. Goodman said 10,000 animals are killed each year during trauma training conducted by the military and private military contractors. Up to a third of those animal deaths are attributed to training on or around Fort Bragg, and several thousand more are attributed to civilian contractors who do work for various military groups. Dr. John Pippin, a Dallas cardiologist who advocates on behalf of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, said it is important to realize that this isn't a choice between saving a soldier and saving a goat. ""The use of goats and pigs for this type of training, if it was ever the best method, is not the best now,"" he said. ""Anyone who tells you it's choosing between a goat and a soldier is devoid of a valid argument. That's a cop-out. It's not the only way or the best way."" The committee helped to craft a bill last year that would force the Department of Defense to end the practice of using live animals in trauma training within five years. That bill did not pass the U.S. House but served as the basis for the language inserted into the authorization act, officials said. Pippin said the use of live animals in medical training was commonplace when he went through medical school in the late 1970s. But even then, he said, many questioned the practice. ""We just knew, intuitively, that this was not relevant,"" he said. Now, only about five medical schools out of nearly 180 in the United States and Canada use live animals as part of their curriculum, Pippin said. 'Cut suits' Pippin and Goodman advocate for the use of various simulators, including ""cut suits"" that they say are better suited for the trauma training. Some simulators look like humans, they said, and feature lifelike skin, anatomically correct organs, breakable bones and realistic blood flow. Others can be worn by humans while still providing many of the realistic features. ""The anatomy and physiology of a goat and a pig are dramatically different from humans,"" Goodman said. ""The simulators are better in all regards."" Goodman and Pippin said many military schools moved to simulators long ago, including the Rascon School of Combat Medicine at Fort Campbell, Ky., the Air Force Center for Sustainment of Trauma and Readiness Skills and the Navy Trauma Training Center. PETA officials said Camp Lejeune, at one point, also stopped using live animals in training. Lejeune officials did not respond to inquiries, but government documents show that officials on the Marine base do use live animals for trauma training, stating on bid paperwork that the live tissue training ""has proven to save lives and lessen the severity of injury in combat."" Goodman said PETA would ask the Marine Corps to cease the use of animals in training. Part of the problem, Goodman said, is that the training curriculum within the military is decentralized, with no overarching structure. The use of live animals occurs on at least 20 bases across the country, he said. But, he said, it's largely nonexistent in other parts of the world. Twenty-two of the 28 countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have banned the use of live animals in training, Goodman said. And news reports indicate that German officials have barred U.S. soldiers stationed in that country from training involving live animals in the past. Once the military's ban on using live animals is in place, Goodman said, it will bring the U.S. up to the standards set by those countries, while improving the training itself. ""It's a win-win,"" he said. Staff writer Drew Brooks can be reached at brooksd@fayobserver.com or 486-3567. ___ (c)2013 The Fayetteville Observer (Fayetteville, N.C.)

1897,714 words,"The Capital Times (Madison, Wisconsin)",SPORTS; OUTDOORS; Pg. 4D,"PILS, HAUGLEY: TWO WHO CARE",2006,"This first column of each new year traditionally features two local outdoorsmen who have made a positive difference in the world of natural resources. This year, Chuck Pils of Madison and Henry Haugley of Sun Prairie are examples of the hundreds of men and women who volunteer. They work behind the scenes to improve fish and wildlife habitat, to teach outdoor skills and to work on behalf of conservation organizations. Although Pils retired in 1999 as the director of Endangered Resources for the Department of Natural Resources, no moss has grown under his boots since then. Born in Chicago, Pils grew up hunting, fishing and trapping because his father and uncle were outdoorsmen from Wausau. He received a master's degree in zoology from Southern Illinois University, then began working at the Wisconsin Conservation Department in 1966. His career included wildlife research, wildlife management, and endangered resources. He is an avid ruffed grouse, deer and pheasant hunter, hunting with his yellow Labrador, Maddy, in Wisconsin, Iowa and South Dakota. Watching the dog work is 99 percent of the enjoyment Pils gets from hunting. Pils volunteers with the Wisconsin LeagueofConservationVoters, InternationalCraneFoundation, the Wildlife Society and Madison Audubon Society, and serves on the board of directors as past-president of the University of Wisconsin Friends of the Arboretum. ""The major reason I volunteer is to help promote good conservation legislation,"" Pils said. ""Getting good legislation passed, or defeating bad legislation, gives me great personal satisfaction."" As a volunteer with the Wildlife Society he helped ensure that Wisconsin qualified for grants totaling more than $1 million for Wildlife Species of Greatest Conservation Need. ""There is strength and power in numbers, and synergy develops when groups get together to get ideas passed,"" Pils said. He has seen hunting and fishing fraternities change in how they view other groups, from antagonists to allies. ""I think that hunting and fishing organizations are getting together more with groups that traditionally are non-hunting, but more needs to be done. People need to walk in the other person's moccasins,"" Pils said. His major conservation concerns today are global warming and loss of wildlife habitat. Fearing the effect housing expansion and loss of wetlands will have on birds, reptiles and amphibians, he encourages people to live in cities (rather than build in the country) and to support endangered resources. Haugley, originally from Fairbault, Minnesota, has a bachelor's degree in Art Education from Mankato State College and taught art at Madison East High School from 1968 to 2000. Haugley grew up fishing with his dad, and after moving to Madison he met Dick Berge, who piqued his interest in trout fishing and TroutUnlimited. He now is an avid trout angler, as well as a deer and pheasant hunter. ""My big interest is in tying flies, and then trying to catch trout on the flies that I tie,"" he said. ""I also enjoy teaching others how to tie flies."" Today he is a member of the Southern Wisconsin Chapter of TroutUnlimited, the Token Creek Watershed Association, Badger Fly Fishers, the River Alliance and DucksUnlimited. Haugley teaches fly tying classes for TU and has served as vice-president and president of the Southern Wisconsin Chapter of TU. He has been involved in the State Council of TU, chairing its education committee. He has been on the Board of Directors of the Madison Fishing Expo and now is the vice chairman of the Token Creek Watershed Association. His efforts helped to get grants for trout stream habitat improvement and helped to get assistance to restore the brook trout fishery on Token Creek. ""I like to be involved and be a part of something that I think is a good thing,"" Haugley said. ""My major conservation concern is clean, fresh water,"" he said. ""Development happens, it won't be stopped, but we would like it to be done in a way to protect what we have. Development can be tempered or directed to protect these things, such as clean water, that are irreplaceable."" Haugley knows that some outdoorsmen don't like to get involved in politics, but politicians can take things away. For that reason he encourages sportsmen to be aware and involved in politics.","['internationalcranefound', 'is', 'help', 'promot', 'said', 'get', 'pass', 'def', 'giv', 'help', 'ens', 'qual', 'tot', 'grew', 'fish', 'mov', 'madison', 'met', 'piqu', 'troutunlimit', 'is', 'is', 'tying', 'try', 'catch', 'said', 'enjoy', 'teach', 'tie', 'is', 'troutunlimit', 'watersh', 'fish', 'ducksunlimit', 'fly', 'tying', 'has', 'serv', 'has', 'been', 'involv', 'chair', 'has', 'been', 'is', 'watersh']",241,46,[],0,[],0,[],0,['pass'],1,['promot'],1,"['promot', 'teach']",2,[],0,"['promot', 'said', 'said']",3,7
63081,1029 words,St. Louis Post-Dispatch (Missouri),EDITORIAL; Pg. 7B,"HERBICIDES, PESTICIDES AND HUMAN HEALTH; TIGHTER FEDERAL STANDARDS ARE NEEDED ON CANCER-CAUSING SUBSTANCES",1996,"Last summer the Mississippi River Basin Alliance, with headquarters in St. Louis, and the EnvironmentalWorkingGroup, in Washington, D.C., sponsored a study of pesticides in drinking water. The St. Louis Audubon Society participated in the study. From the middle of May through the end of August, samples of drinking water taken at a downtown office location were mailed to the University of Iowa for analysis. Each sample was tested for two commoniy used herbicides or weed killers, atrazine and cyanazine. A few samples were subjected to tests capable of detecting up to 11 different herbicides. Atrazine, marketed by the Swiss firm Ciba Geigy under the trade name AAtrex, is also widely used in combination with other weed killers. It is most often used on corn and is the most widely used herbicide in the United States. Cyanazine belongs to the same family of herbicides, the triazines. It is manufactured by DuPont and sold under the trade name Bladex. It is also used in corn fields and is the fourth most commonly used herbicide. Our survey found that concentrations of atrazine and cyanazine both peaked on June 11 when drinking water samples contained 2.6 and 2.4 parts per billion, respectively, of the two herbicides. Farmers apply these herbicides in the spring and early summer, when they reach their highest concentrations in our rivers. Average concentrations for atrazine and cyanazine during the testing period were 1.56 and 0.66 ppb, respectively. Six different pesticides in varying concentrations were detected in one sample taken at the end of June. Atrazine has been demonstrated to be a carcinogen in animals, but studies with humans are less conclusive. Hence, atrazine is classified by the EPA as a ""possible human carcinogen."" EPA's Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water ignores possible carcinogenic effects in setting federal standards for drinking water. Using toxicological effects unrelated to possible carcinogenic activity, the agency has set a maximum contaminant level of 3 ppb for atrazine. Federal standards require only that the average concentration over a period of a year be below the maximum contaminant level. One reason the levels of atrazine in our city water samples were below the federal standards for drinking water is that, during the season of pesticide use, the city analyzes the water daily and, when necessary, adds powdered activated carbon, which absorbs much of the contaminant and is subsequently filtered out. Many other cities may not do that. The Office of Pesticide Programs, which regulates pesticide concentrations in foods, has set a permissible level for atrazine in food about 19 times lower than the standard for drinking water. Under this standard, the acceptable level for drinking water would be approximately 0.16 parts per billion. In many European countries the equivalent standard is 0.1 parts per billion. Atrazine is banned in Italy, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, Austria and Hungary. Cyanazine has been shown to be a carcinogen in animals, where it also causes birth defects and skeletal abnormalities. As is the case with atrazine, EPA does not recognize the possible carcinogenic effects of cyanazine in humans. Cyanazine has been described as perhaps the most toxic of the herbicides found in drinking water. The concentration of cyanazine in three of our samples exceeded the lifetime health advisory set by the EPA, but the average over a year will be well below the standard. In August, the EPA announced that DuPont had voluntarily agreed to phase out production of cyanazine. This followed EPA's decision to do a ""special review"" of the triazines. Instead of participating in that costly review, DuPont will put its resources into developing new products, including the sulfonylurea class of herbicides that work through plant enzymes not present in mammals and that are far less toxic to humans. Certain herbicides similar to atrazine and cyanazine mimic the action of hormones, such as estrogen, in the body and, therefore, affect the reproductive functions. These substances act as endocrine disrupters; i.e., they interfere with the hormonal secretions that control the response of the body to external stimuli and to fetal and sexual development. So far our knowledge of the effects of these substances on the human body are speculative. We have a number of examples of their effects on wildlife, but little knowledge of the levels at which similar effects might become apparent in the human body. An example of effects on wildlife is that of alligators hatched in Lake Apopka, Fla., in an area subjected to discharges from a pesticide manufacturing plant. Male alligators have abnormally small reproductive organs and exhibit both male and female characteristics. They are unable to reproduce effectively. A report to the commission that oversees the cleanup of the Great Lakes region showed that babies whose mothers had eaten contaminated fish in Lake Ontario were less able to cope with stress and were more easily frustrated than normal babies. A Finnish study cited evidence that the sperm count in men from the industrialized countries of Europe and North America has decreased by 50 percent in the past 40 years. Pesticides are a suspected cause. A report in last October's Scientific American suggests a link between pesticides and breast cancer in women. Though the concentrations for atrazine and cyanazine in city drinking water were within federal standards, those standards are laxer than those for food products. Federal standards should be revised to recognize possible carcinogenic effects, cumulative effects of multiple herbicides and the special risks to children. Missouri's soil conservation program not only conserves top soil but plays an important role in limiting the agricultural runoff that carries pesticides into our streams. Farmers should be urged to use herbicides that are effective through mechanisms that are less toxic to humans. Urban residents have a large stake in reauthorizing, without change, the parks and soils conservation sales tax that supports both state parks and soil conservation.","['spons', 'lou', 'particip', 'tak', 'wer', 'mail', 'was', 'test', 'us', 'atrazin', 'cyanazin']",79,11,['mail'],1,[],0,['test'],1,['test'],1,['spons'],1,['mail'],1,[],0,[],0,5
20721,573 words,Saint Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota),METRO; Pg. 1C,REPORT GIVES WATER THE FREE AND CLEAR; TESTS REBUT CLAIMS ABOUT DRINKING SUPPLY,1995,"Despite claims to the contrary, Minnesota's community drinking water supplies are mostly free of pesticides and industrial contaminants, state Health Department officials announced Thursday. Only 0.14 percent of the nearly 125,000 tests performed last year on 583 community water systems across the state showed any traces of pesticides and industrial contaminants, said Pat Bloomgren, director of the department's Division of Environmental Health. None of the trace amounts exceeded federal safe drinking water limits, she said. The report, the first issued by the department, was prompted by recent contentions by national environmental groups, including the National Resources Defense Council and the EnvironmentalWorkingGroup, that drinking water supplies in Minnesota and the rest of the nation are unsafe. ""These test results underscore something that we've known for a long time,"" acting commissioner Anne Barry said. ""Our state's public water supply systems are very safe, and they generally have very few problems with contamination."" Bloomgren said the groups do not test water, but instead get raw data from the Environmental Protection Agency and then draw their own inaccurate conclusions. Minnesota has 965 community water systems, ranging in size from the large systems in St. Paul and Minneapolis to small systems that supply mobile home parks or apartment buildings. Treated water is tested for up to 118 different pesticides and industrial contaminants at intervals ranging from four times a year to once every six years, depending on risk factors. In addition, the water is tested for bacteria, nitrates and inorganic chemicals, radioactive elements, lead and copper. Under the regulations, if any test exceeds federal limits, the water system's operator is required to notify customers immediately and then correct the problem. The last community water system in Minnesota to exceed federal limits was in Swanville, a small city southwest of Little Falls. Its water was contaminated in the early 1990s with benzene caused by a petroleum leak. The problem was resolved when the city began using water from a well located outside the pollution zone, Health Department officials said. Although the Health Department has been routinely testing community water systems under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act since 1977, it has never made the results public until now. Barry said the test reports will be released on an annual basis to provide Minnesotans ""with a badly needed sense of perspective."" ""A number of recent news reports - many of them based on information provided by environmental activist groups - have suggested that we have widespread problems with our drinking water,"" she said. ""In fact, that's simply not the case."" While Minnesota's drinking water monitoring system is considered among the best in the nation, threats still loom on the horizon, Bloomgren said. One involves a new breed of pathogens, which can sicken customers within hours. The other involves badly outdated delivery systems. In the spring of 1993, more than 400,000 Milwaukee residents developed flu-like symptoms after their water supply became contaminated with cryptosporidium, an intestinal parasite. Last winter, a water pipe that was more than 100 years old broke in downtown St. Paul. And some communities in the Twin Cities and elsewhere still have wooden water pipes, Bloomgren said.","['issu', 'was', 'prompt', 'includ', 'ar', 'undersc', 'wev', 'known', 'act', 'said', 'ar', 'hav', 'said', 'do', 'test', 'get', 'draw']",100,17,[],0,[],0,"['issu', 'test']",2,"['issu', 'test']",2,[],0,[],0,[],0,"['said', 'said']",2,6
132406,886 words,The New York Times,Section C; Column 1; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 2,Study Questions Prospects for Much Lower Emissions,2007,"As Democratic leaders in Congress prepare to put climate change legislation on the agenda, some in the utility industry are arguing that it will take decades of investments and innovation to get substantial reductions in their emissions of greenhouse gases. Electric power companies, which emit about one-third of America's global warming gases, could reduce their emissions to below the levels of 1990, but that would take about 20 years, no matter how much the utilities spend, according to a new industry study. The report, prepared by the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit consortium, is portrayed as highly optimistic by its authors, who will present the findings on Thursday at an energy conference in Houston. It assumes that ''money grows on trees and all research is successful,'' said one of them, Bryan J. Hannegan. ''This is as good as we think we can get, right now.'' Before joining the research institute last year, Dr. Hannegan, a climate scientist, worked as an environmental and economic adviser to the White House and on the Republican staff of the Senate Energy Committee, where he helped draft the 2005 energy bill. His detailed new analysis comes as Democrats in Congress are promising to draft tough new targets for emissions of greenhouse gases, possibly including mandatory caps, which the Bush administration and industry groups have opposed in the past. The 1990 Kyoto Protocol on climate change, which the Bush administration declined to support in 2001, calls for emissions from large industrial nations to be below 1990 levels by about the year 2010. In an interview, Dr. Hannegan said that cutting carbon dioxide that much would mean pursuing every option, including energy efficiency, zero-carbon wind and sun power; new nuclear reactors; coal plants that capture and sequester their carbon; and even plug-in hybrid electric cars, which would require making more electricity but would reduce carbon dioxide and save gasoline. At the NaturalResourcesDefenseCouncil, David G. Hawkins, an energy and climate expert, said that the industry group's projections would not provide the necessary savings soon enough. ''We think the efficiency, renewables and carbon dioxide capture wedges can all be bigger,'' Mr. Hawkins said. He added that whatever overall reduction was achieved in carbon output, the electric sector would have to exceed the average, because it had greater potential than industry or transportation to reduce emissions. But he said it was not clear that the country could build as many nuclear reactors as the research institute's outline called for, at least not without solving problems with nuclear waste and fear of proliferation. The industry study calls for 64 gigawatts of additional nuclear power by 2030, an increase of about two-thirds from the current level. For the first time in three decades, several companies have expressed interest recently in ordering new reactors, but they will probably take nearly 10 years to build and experts expect no more than six or eight in the first round. The study's figure implies a net increase of about 50 new reactors by 2030; the Energy Department is counting on about 10. The study also calls for cutting the growth in demand for electricity, which the Energy Department expects to increase at 1.5 percent a year. The study assumes growth of just 1.1 percent a year, which implies a steady decline in electricity use for each unit of economic production. It also calls for vast growth in wind energy and some solar energy. Renewable energy (leaving out hydroelectricity) now comes to only a little over 2 percent of kilowatt-hours generated; by 2030, it would be 6.7 percent. The biggest slice, though, is from coal plants that would capture their carbon dioxide, compress it and pipe it underground for sequestration. This is a technology that has been barely demonstrated at this point. But in a little over 20 years, it would have to produce 14.6 percent of electricity supplies. The technologies required do exist, at least at laboratory scale. But the study does not predict costs and stipulate what is economically feasible. Many of the changes forecast by the utility group depend on prices and on consumer attitudes. For example, it projects that 10 percent of new vehicle sales by 2017 will be plug-in hybrids, which would carry enough batteries to run a car for the first 20 or 30 miles daily; on days when a motorist went farther, the fuel would be gasoline. There are no commercially available batteries for that task, however, and hybrids sold today constitute a tiny fraction of the market. The study counts on upgrading existing coal plants, to make them more efficient. But refurbishing old plants might not be as effective as replacing them, Mr. Hawkins said. Older coal plants now in service are typically about 33 percent efficient, meaning that two-thirds of the energy in the coal is lost in the generating process. The study sets a target of 49 percent efficiency by 2030. Jeff Sterba, the chairman of the industry research group and the chief executive of PNM, the parent company of Public Service of New Mexico, is scheduled to present the study on Thursday morning at a conference organized by the consulting firm Cambridge Energy Research Associates.","['hawkin', 'said', 'provid', 'think', 'be', 'said', 'ad', 'was', 'achiev', 'hav', 'excess', 'had', 'reduc', 'said', 'was', 'build', 'institut', 'cal', 'solv']",110,19,['cal'],1,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,[],0,"['reduc', 'build']",2,"['said', 'said', 'said']",3,6

31352,398 words,Palm Beach Post (Florida),A SECTION; Pg. 10A,STATE REFUGE AMONG 10 NAMED IN LAWSUIT AIMED AT PROTECTING MANATEES,1992,"A wildlife refuge on Florida's west coast was among 10 areas named in a lawsuit in which three environmental groups argue that the U.S. Interior Department and Fish and Wildlife Service allow military and recreational activities harmful to manatees. The lawsuit contends that wildlife may be in danger at 484 refuges nationally, but it named just 10, including the Crystal River National Wildlife Refuge. The 43-acre refuge north of the Tampa-St. Petersburg area and south of Cedar Key is made up of undeveloped islands, submerged lands and waters. The refuge also is the winter habitat for 24 percent of Florida's population of endangered West Indian manatees, the suit said. The NationalAudubonSociety, the Wilderness Society and the DefendersofWildlife filed the lawsuit this week in Seattle, the site of another refuge. The wildlife groups contend the nation's refuges are being used for grazing, military air exercises, motorboating and water sports, which are incompatible with protecting wildlife, the primary reason for their existence. At the Crystal River refuge, the manatees are threatened by recreational activities, including boating, underwater photography, diving, camping and swimming. The refuge manager reported in 1990 that recreational uses were causing endangered manatees to alter their feeding, resting and breeding behavior, the suit said. He recommended the refuge be closed to water activities from Oct. 1 to March 31. He also asked for an increase in wildlife officers and public education and for a larger budget. ""The need . . . cannot be overstated,"" he said, according to the lawsuit. But wildlife service officials say the agency has almost resolved the problem, spokesman Hugh Vickery said. Vickery said the wildlife service has been working for two years to eliminate incompatible uses at wildlife refuges after a General Accounting Office study found certain secondary activities were harmful to wildlife. A second lawsuit was filed specifically objecting to ""refuge bombing"" in military air exercises, said DefendersofWildlife spokesperson Lisa Swann. The suit is about the Copalis National Wildlife Refuge in Washington state. But it also lists other refuges nationwide where low-flying jet bombers jeopardize migrating birds. There are six refuges affected -- the Florida Panther Refuge, Passage Key, Merritt Island, Lower Suwannee, Cedar Keys and Key West refuges, the suit said.","['fil', 'contend', 'ar', 'being', 'us', 'graz', 'motorbo', 'ar', 'protect', 'refug', 'ar', 'threatened', 'includ', 'boat', 'div', 'swim', 'report', 'wer', 'caus', 'endang', 'alt', 'said', 'was', 'fil', 'object', 'refug', 'said', 'swan', 'is', 'list', 'lowf', 'jeopard', 'migr', 'ar', 'affect', 'refug', 'said']",165,37,['jeopard'],1,"['div', 'jeopard']",2,"['fil', 'report', 'fil']",3,"['fil', 'fil']",2,[],0,"['report', 'list']",2,['protect'],1,"['said', 'said', 'said']",3,14
