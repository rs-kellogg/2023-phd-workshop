    "## Theory of Random Coefficients Logit\n",
    "\n",
    "The random coefficients model extends the plain logit model by allowing for correlated tastes for different product characteristics.\n",
    "In this  model (indirect) utility is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_{ijt} = \\alpha_i p_{jt} + x_{jt} \\beta_i^\\text{ex} + \\xi_{jt} + \\epsilon_{ijt}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The main addition is that $\\beta_i = (\\alpha_i, \\beta_i^\\text{ex})$ have individual specific subscripts $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional on $\\beta_i$, the individual market share follow the same logit form as before. But now we must integrate over heterogeneous individuals to get the aggregate market share:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_{jt}(\\alpha, \\beta, \\theta) = \\int \\frac{\\exp(\\alpha_i p_{jt} + x_{jt} \\beta_i^\\text{ex} + \\xi_{jt})}{1 + \\sum_k \\exp(\\alpha_i p_{jt} + x_{kt} \\beta_i^\\text{ex} + \\xi_{kt})} f(\\alpha_i, \\beta_i \\mid \\theta).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, this integral needs to be calculated numerically. This also means that we can't directly linearize the model. It is common to re-parametrize the model to separate the aspects of mean utility that all individuals agree on, $\\delta_{jt} = \\alpha p_{jt} + x_{jt} \\beta^\\text{ex} + \\xi_{jt}$, from the individual specific heterogeneity, $\\mu_{ijt}(\\theta)$. This gives us\n",

    "$$s_{jt}(\\delta_{jt}, \\theta) = \\int \\frac{\\exp(\\delta_{jt} + \\mu_{ijt})}{1 + \\sum_k \\exp(\\delta_{kt} + \\mu_{ikt})} f(\\mu_{it} | \\theta).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a guess of $\\theta$ we can solve the system of nonlinear equations for the vector $\\delta$ which equates observed and predicted market share $s_{jt} = s_{jt}(\\delta, \\theta)$. Now we can perform a linear IV GMM regression of the form\n",

    "To include random coefficients we need to add a [`Formulation`](https://pyblp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_api/pyblp.Formulation.html#pyblp.Formulation) for the demand-side nonlinear characteristics $X_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in the logit case we have the same reserved field names in `product_data`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `market_ids` are the unique market identifiers which we subscript $t$.\n",
    "- `shares` specifies the market share which need to be between zero and one, and within a market ID, $\\sum_{j} s_{jt} < 1$.\n",
    "- `prices` are prices $p_{jt}$. These have some special properties and are _always_ treated as endogenous.\n",
    "- `demand_instruments0`, `demand_instruments1`, and so on are numbered demand instruments. These represent only the _excluded_ instruments. The exogenous regressors in $X_1$ (of which $X_2$ is typically a subset) will be automatically added to the set of instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We proceed with the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the `product data` which at a minimum consists of `market_ids`, `shares`, `prices`, and at least a single column of demand instruments, `demand_instruments0`.\n",
    "2. Define a [`Formulation`](https://pyblp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_api/pyblp.Formulation.html#pyblp.Formulation) for the $X_1$ (linear) demand model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This and all other formulas are similar to R and [patsy](https://patsy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) formulas.\n",
    "    - It includes a constant by default. To exclude the constant, specify either a `0` or a `-1`.\n",
    "    - To efficiently include fixed effects, use the `absorb` option and specify which categorical variables you would like to absorb.\n",
    "    - Some model reduction may happen automatically. The constant will be excluded if you include fixed effects and some precautions are taken against collinearity. However, you will have to make sure that differently-named variables are not collinear.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Define a [`Formulation`](https://pyblp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_api/pyblp.Formulation.html#pyblp.Formulation) for the $X_2$ (nonlinear) demand model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Include only the variables over which we want random coefficients.\n",
    "    - Do not absorb or include fixed effects.\n",
    "    - It will include a random coefficient on the constant (to capture inside good vs. outside good preference) unless you specify not to with a `0` or a `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Define an [`Integration`](https://pyblp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_api/pyblp.Integration.html#pyblp.Integration) configuration to solve the market share integral from several available options:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Monte Carlo integration (pseudo-random draws).\n",
    "    - Product rule quadrature.\n",
    "    - Sparse grid quadrature.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Combine [`Formulation`](https://pyblp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_api/pyblp.Formulation.html#pyblp.Formulation) classes, `product_data`, and the [`Integration`](https://pyblp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_api/pyblp.Integration.html#pyblp.Integration) configuration to construct a [`Problem`](https://pyblp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_api/pyblp.Problem.html#pyblp.Problem).\n",
    "4. Use the [`Problem.solve`](https://pyblp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_api/pyblp.Problem.solve.html#pyblp.Problem.solve) method to estimate paramters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It is required to specify an initial guess of the nonlinear parameters. This serves two primary purposes: speeding up estimation and indicating to the solver through initial values of zero which parameters are restricted to be always zero."

    "2. A $K_2 \\times K_2$ covariance matrix, $V$. As is common with multivariate normal distributions, $V$ is not estimated directly. Rather, its matrix square (Cholesky) root $\\Sigma$ is estimated where $\\Sigma\\Sigma' = V$.\n",
    "3. Any $K_2 \\times D$ interactions, $\\Pi$, with observed $D \\times 1$ demographic data, $d_i$.\n",

It guarantees that $\\hat{\\Sigma}$ (the estimated parameters) will have the same sparsity structure as $\\Sigma_0$. So any zero element of $\\Sigma$ is restricted to be zero in the solution $\\hat{\\Sigma}$. For example, a popular restriction is that $\\Sigma$ is diagonal, this can be achieved by passing a diagonal matrix as $\\Sigma_0$."
